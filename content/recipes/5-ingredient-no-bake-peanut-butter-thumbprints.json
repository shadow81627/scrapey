    "1/2 cup natural creamy salted peanut butter (or sub other nut / seed butter)",
    "1 pinch sea salt",
    "1/4 cup maple syrup",
    "1 1/3 cup almond flour (or half this amount in coconut flour, plus more as needed)",
    "1 cup dried unsweetened fruit (we used half wild blueberries, half cherries)",
    "2 Tbsp warm water"

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Measure out almond flour and add a little at a time until a workable dough forms (see photo). If too dry/crumbly, add more peanut butter or maple syrup. If too sticky or wet, add a little more almond flour. We added an additional few tablespoons to achieve the right consistency."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Scoop dough out in 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts (I like using this scoop) and gently roll into balls. Then pick up one cookie at a time and cradle it in your palm. Use your pointer finger or thumb to make an indent, being careful not to press too forcefully to prevent cracking. If the dough cracks, smooth the cracks over before chilling. Continue until all cookies are pressed, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "To make your jam, add dried fruit to a food processor and blend until a ball forms or only small bits remain. Then add warm water 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until a thick paste forms, scraping down sides as needed. Be careful not to add too much water or the jam will become too wet. We found 2 Tbsp (30 ml) to be the right consistency (as the recipe is written). You’re looking for a paste consistency."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Remove cookies from refrigerator and add 1/2 tsp of jam to the center of each cookie. Press down to situate the jam as needed. Repeat until all cookies are filled. You’ll have leftover jam which you can cover, refrigerate, and reserve for future cookies, PB&J sandwiches, or oats!"
