Drain, keeping back a tiny amount of the cooking water. Return the pasta to the pan and toss together. Stir three-quarters of the ricotta cheese into the spinach mixture, taste, and season, if needed. Toss the sauce with the pasta and serve with a scattering of the remaining ricotta cheese and a splash of extra virgin olive oil."
