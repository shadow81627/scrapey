  "description": "This vegan tikka masala is rich, creamy and packed with flavor! Made with tender cauliflower florets and hearty chickpeas are simmered in a spicy cashew tomato sauce, you'd never guess this cozy curry was dairy free. A delicious Indian-inspired dinner that tastes like it came from a restaurant and is easy enough for a weeknight!",
