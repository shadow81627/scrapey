      "text": "Collect the ingredients before you start cooking. It can be really annoying to begin preparation, only to discover that you've run out of something important. TIP1: make sure the oyster sauce has at least 10% oyster extract (some have as little as 0.5%, but a really good one can be 30% or more - well worth the extra). TIP2: I use Greek Basil. It grows quickly into a bush, lasts for 2 or more years, and the leaves are so small you don't need to chop them. As you can see in the photo, I also used Thai Basil this time"

      "text": "A number of Asian recipes call for thinly sliced beef (or other meat). The real reason for this is two-fold. Firstly, meat is very expensive in some countries, and so slicing it thinly makes it go further. Secondly, meat (at affordable prices) in some countries tends to be tough, and thin slices are easier to eat. Woollies 5 Star beef mince has a lovely flavour, so I don't recommend marinating it for this dish. In fact, you will taste all the separate flavours of the ingredients this way."
