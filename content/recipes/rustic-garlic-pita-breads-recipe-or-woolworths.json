      "text": "Using a good quality non stick pan, cook each pita for 1-2 minutes on each side on a medium-high heat. The timer app on your phone may help with this. It is very important not to cook these for longer than 2 minutes each side of the will become very hard and crunchy. Which is lovely as a chip but if you are wanting a soft flexible wrap try and keep the time to a minimum."
