      "text": "Rinse and dry your sweet potatoes thoroughly and slice them as uniformly thin as possible (~1/8-1/16 inch thick slices). If you have a mandolin, use it. Otherwise, use a very sharp knife to get these uniformly thin. Know that chips that are too thick in parts won't crisp up all the way. Still delicious, just not \"chip\" crispiness."

      "text": "Toss slices in a touch of olive oil to lightly coat, then sprinkle with salt. Lay out in a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet and bake for about 1 hour 30 minutes to 1 hour 45 minutes, flipping chips once at halfway point to ensure even cooking. I also rotated mine for more even cooking (optional but recommended). Note: thickness of slices will impact cooking time. Check at ~10 minute intervals during the second hour of cooking to ensure they aren't burning."
