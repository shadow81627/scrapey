Cut little pieces of vegan mozzarella to make the jack-o-lantern face.For the skull: use a skull-shaped cookie cutter on a slice of vegan mozzarella. Make the face with pieces of black olive.For the large spider: cut a circle of vegan mozzarella or cheddar for the base (optional). Slice a black olive in half lengthwise for the body, and another olive in half crosswise for the head. Slice olive rings and then cut rings in half to make the legs.For the eyes: use a small round cookie cutter on vegan mozzarella to make the whites of the eyes. Use a smaller circle cutter (I used a piping tip) to cut green bell pepper for the iris. Then use and even smaller circle cutter (I used the point of the piping tip) to cut black olives to make the pupils.For the bugs: slice black olives in half lengthwise for the bodies. Cut olive rings, then slice them in half or in quarters to make the legs.For the ghost: use a ghost-shaped cookie cutter on vegan mozzarella. Use a knife or small circle cutter (I used the point of a piping tip) on black olives to make the eyes and mouth.For the mummy: cut strips of vegan mozzarella for the wrap. Use black olive rings for the eyes."
