Process until well-blended, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl halfway through to reincorporate any stray ingredients. Transfer the marinade to a container large enough to fit the short ribs, add the meat, and turn to coat with the marinade. Cover and refrigerate for 1 to 2 hours."

Cover and grill for 1 to 3 minutes per side, or until the steak is cooked to your liking. (The marinade burns quickly, so watch any hot spots on your grill carefully.) Transfer to a platter, let the meat rest for a minute or two, then serve immediately."
