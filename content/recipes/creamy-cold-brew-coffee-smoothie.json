Also be sure to peel, thinly slice, and freeze bananas on a parchment-lined baking sheet or plate the night before as well.Also prep your cold brew coffee the day before. Do so by grinding 1 cup of coffee into a semi-coarse texture (about the texture of sea salt) and topping with 2 cups of cool filtered water. Cover and refrigerate for 12 hours (or overnight)."
