    "1/2 cup 1 stick unsalted butter",

      "text": "Place the butter in a small saucepan set over medium-low heat. Warm just until sizzling. Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, and cayenne (if using) to a blender. Blend at medium speed for about 1 minute, until well-blended and yolks are pale. With the blender running on medium, very slowly and carefully stream the butter into the egg yolk mixture. The yolks will cook thanks to the heat of the butter, and the sauce will form. It will be pale yellow and fairly runny. Pour into a bowl and keep in a warm place until ready to serve. I usually set mine over a bowl of warm water."
