    "description": "When you're in need of something crisp and refreshing alongside whatever you're serving — be it grilled shrimp or a roast chicken — let this be your go-to dish. Quick-pickled cucumbers and plenty of dill join forces in a classic salad that's tangy and bright. It's a recipe that requires very little of you, aside from a bit of slicing and chopping, and since it gets better with a night's rest it's a make-ahead dream. So there's really no reason not to add it to your repertoire.",
