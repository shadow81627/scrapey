      "text": "Sift the flour into a large mixing bowl, add the baking powder and brown sugar, and stir well. Mix in the eggs and the melted butter to make a smooth batter. Pour into the tin and smooth the top. Arrange the apple slices in three or four long lines along the top of the mixture and sprinkle with the caster sugar. Bake for 45 minutes, or until the cake is firm to the touch and a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean."

      "text": "Meanwhile, make the sauce by melting the butter, sugar, and lemon juice in a pan with a pinch of salt, whisking with an electric hand whisk until the mixture is thick, melted, and smooth. Leave to cool slightly. Pour the sauce over the cake while it is still in the tin, gently brushing the sauce all over the top of the cake. Serve warm or cold with a spoonful of crème fraîche, if you like."
