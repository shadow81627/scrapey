Carefully cut a wide lid off of the top by working your knife around the stem at a 45-degree angle until you've cut all the way around and the lid comes off. A wide opening makes it easier to fill and serve the pumpkin, so err on the side of a large lid rather than a small one. Cut the stringy bits and seeds off of the lid with a knife or kitchen shears. Scoop out the seeds and stringy flesh until the pumpkin cavity is hollow and smooth. Season the inside of the pumpkin and the lid with 3/4 teaspoon of the salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the pepper. Transfer to a parchment paper-lined rimmed baking sheet."
