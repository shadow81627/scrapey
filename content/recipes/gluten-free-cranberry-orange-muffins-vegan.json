Whisk well, until there is no separation between the oil and other wet ingredients. Add the almond flour, oat flour, potato starch, baking powder, baking soda, and salt. Whisk thoroughly to fully combine and break up any flour clumps. Lastly, fold in the cranberries, making sure to distribute them evenly throughout the batter."

Let the muffins cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes before removing and letting cool for at least 15 more on a cooling rack. Then they can be enjoyed warm or at room temperature!"
