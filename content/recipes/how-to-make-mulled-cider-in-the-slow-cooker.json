  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Apple cider: Buy fresh apple cider or unfiltered apple juice for the best flavor. Do not use sparkling cider, spiced cider, hard cider, or clear apple juice.Optional add-in spices: You can add any combination of the following spices to make a more complex-tasting cider: 4 star anise pods, 1/2 teaspoon whole black peppercorns, or 1/2 teaspoon whole allspice berries.Spiking: For individual spiked ciders, place liquor bottles next to the slow cooker for people to spike their own drink. Rye whiskey, rum, or bourbon are great matches for mulled cider.Storage: Leftover cider can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.Stovetop directions: This recipe is designed for the slow cooker, but you can also simmer the cider covered over low heat on the stovetop for about 1 hour."
