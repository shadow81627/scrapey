  "description": "This flavorful vegan jambalaya is more like a paella or Spanish rice than a traditional jambalaya. It uses tofu that has been frozen, giving it a great chewy texture. The recipe makes about 4-6 servings. Once you’ve had this recipe, you’ll do like I do and keep a package of tofu in the freezer at all times!",
