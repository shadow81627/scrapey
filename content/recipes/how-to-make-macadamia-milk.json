    "1 cup raw macadamia nuts",
    "3-4 cups water (use less water for thicker, creamier milk // more water for thinner milk)",
    "1 pinch salt",
    "1 whole date, pitted (optional // for sweetness // or 1 Tbsp (15 ml) maple syrup)",
    "1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)",
    "2 Tbsp cocoa or cacao powder for \"chocolate milk\" (optional)",
    "1/4 cup fresh berries for \"berry milk\" (optional)"

In my experience, it benefits from a single strain either through a very thin towel or nut milk bag. Save pulp for baked goods or to add to oatmeal, smoothies, or energy bites."

Enjoy cold or hot and shake well before use (it tends to separate in the refrigerator). Can be used in smoothies, with granola, for golden milk or matcha lattes, or baked goods!"
