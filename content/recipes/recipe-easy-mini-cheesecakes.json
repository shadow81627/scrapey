    "description": "In my opinion, cheesecake is better in miniature form. A dense, rich slice is more than I can handle after a meal — but a muffin cup-sized portion is just right. These mini cheesecakes are ridiculously creamy, and feature that buttery graham cracker crust everyone agrees on. They're equal parts celebratory and homey, which is really the best kind of dessert.",
