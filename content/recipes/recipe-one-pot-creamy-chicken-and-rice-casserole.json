  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter",
    "1 medium yellow onion, finely chopped",
    "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme, or 1 teaspoon fresh thyme leaves",
    "2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more for seasoning",
    "1 1/2 cups long-grain white rice",
    "1 clove garlic, minced",
    "2 cups low-sodium chicken broth",
    "1 3/4 cups whole or 2% milk",
    "Freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts or thighs, cut into bite-sized pieces",
    "1 cup fresh or frozen peas",
    "1 1/2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided"

      "text": "Add the rice and garlic and cook, stirring occasionally, until they smell toasty, about 1 minute. Add the broth, milk, and remaining 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt, and season with pepper. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally so that the rice doesn't stick to the pot. Add the chicken, stir to combine, and bring back to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the liquid is absorbed and the rice is tender, about 15 minutes. (Add water as needed if the rice absorbs it all before tender. If you'd like a browned top on the casserole, heat the broiler to high now.)"

Sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup cheese, then cover again and let sit for the cheese to melt and the rice to steam, about 5 minutes. (For a browned top, place under the broiler for a few minutes until the cheese turns golden-brown in spots.) Serve immediately."
