Heat over medium-high heat until 350°F. (If you don’t have a thermometer, wait for the oil to start shimmering and test whether it’s ready for frying by dropping a little piece of tortilla into the oil. If it floats to the top and bubbles within a few seconds, it’s ready.) Meanwhile, line a baking sheet with paper towels or set up a wire rack."
