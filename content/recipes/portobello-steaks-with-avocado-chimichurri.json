  "recipeIngredient": [
    "3 large portobello mushrooms (stems removed, wiped clean)",
    "3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil",
    "1/2 tsp cumin",
    "1/2 tsp black pepper",
    "1/4 tsp smoked paprika",
    "3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "1 Tbsp steak sauce (optional // vegan friendly, like A1)",
    "1 1/2 cups finely chopped parsley (either kind will work, but flat leaf Italian parsley is best)",
    "2-3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "1 medium shallot (minced // 1 shallot yields ~1/4 cup chopped)",
    "1/4 tsp red pepper flake",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil (extra virgin when possible)",
    "2 Tbsp lemon juice (for more traditional chimichurri, sub red or white vinegar)",
    "1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper",
    "1 small ripe avocado (cubed // a non-traditional addition, but one that adds healthy fats, fiber, and creaminess!)"

This makes a great standalone meal, but would also pair well with my Pecan Apple Salad, Pear Walnut Salad, or Vegan Mashed Potatoes! They would also pair well with grilled asparagus and/or cooked quinoa, millet, or brown rice. Best when fresh."
