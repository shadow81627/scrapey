  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 Tbsp cane sugar (or maple syrup)",
    "2 cups warm water",
    "1 packet active dry yeast (we used Red Star // 1 packet yields ~2 1/4 tsp or 7 g)",
    "1 cup brown rice flour (plus more for flouring pan)",
    "1 cup sorghum flour*",
    "1 cup potato starch",
    "1 tsp baking powder",
    "4 Tbsp psyllium husk (whole, not powder)",
    "1 1/2 tsp salt",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil (or sub melted vegan butter)"

      "text": "In a glass measuring cup or mixing bowl, whisk together the warm water (100-110 degrees F / 38-43 C) and sugar (or maple syrup) until the sugar is mostly dissolved. Whisk in the packet of yeast and let it bloom on the counter for 10 minutes until frothy. If it doesn’t foam, start over — your water may have been too hot or the packet of yeast was expired."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Meanwhile, in a separate mixing bowl, combine the brown rice flour, sorghum flour, potato starch, baking powder, psyllium husk, and salt. Whisk well until thoroughly combined and any lumps of potato starch are broken up."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once the yeast has proofed, make a slight “well” in the middle of the flour mixture, add water/yeast mixture and the olive oil to the “well,” and use a wooden spoon to begin mixing immediately. The mixture will start out quite loose and liquidy, almost like pancake batter, but don’t worry! As the psyllium husk absorbs the water, it will thicken considerably."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once the mixture has thickened slightly and has no lumps (~1 minute), cover it with a thin kitchen towel and let rise at room temperature for 45 minutes. Once the dough has risen, preheat the oven to 400 F (204 C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Dust a clean work surface with a little brown rice flour. Turn the dough out onto the surface and make it into a rough “log,” then divide it into 12-14 equal pieces. Shape each piece into a neat ball and transfer to the baking tray."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Brush each roll with olive oil or melted vegan butter and set aside to rise for another 10 mins. Bake the rolls on the middle shelf of the oven for 28-32 minutes, or until they are slightly golden and hollow-sounding when you tap the bottoms. Allow to cool on the pan for ~10 minutes. Enjoy these rolls while they’re still warm, with a bit of vegan butter, or cool completely and reheat in the oven when ready to serve."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "These rolls are best on the day they’re made. To keep the rolls fresh and soft, let cool fully then store at room temperature in an airtight container for 1 day. Then transfer to the refrigerator and reheat in the oven or microwave. Freeze for up to 1 month."
