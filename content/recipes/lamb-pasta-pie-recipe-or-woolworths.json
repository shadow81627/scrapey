      "text": "Preheat oven to 200Â°C. Grease an 8-cup capacity baking dish. Cook pasta in a saucepan of salted boiling water following packet instructions until tender. Drain and return to saucepan. Add cream cheese, milk and chives. Toss until well combined. Season with salt and pepper. Spoon lamb mixture into baking dish. Top with pasta mixture. Sprinkle over the grated parmesan. Cook pasta pie for 15 minutes or until the pasta is golden. Serve. Speedy idea: Use lamb mince for the filling instead of rump steak. Then reduce cooking time in step 2 from 1 hour 15 minutes to 20 minutes."
