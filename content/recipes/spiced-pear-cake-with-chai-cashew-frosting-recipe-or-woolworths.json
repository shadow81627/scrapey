Sift in the remaining ingredients and then gently fold the batter together until just mixed. You want to make sure there are no more dry spots of flour, but don't overmix it. Pour into your prepared pan and bang the tin on the bench to even out and remove any air bubbles. Bake for approximately 50mins or until cooked when tested insert a skewer into the middle of the cake. When removed there should be a few moist crumbs but no wet batter. Allow the cake to cool for 5 minutes and then gentle transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."

The mixture is thick so using your tamper if necessary. Taste the frosting and add more icing powder if you like. Transfer the chai frosting to a bowl (or piping bag with a medium round shaped nozzle, if desired) and set in the fridge for 2+ hours."
