Boil on high uncovered for 30 minutes, then strain in a fine-mesh strainer. Let the rice sit in the strainer while you proceed with the recipe."

Add the minced garlic, stir fry veggies (such as carrots and snap peas), and 1 Tbsp (15 ml) tamari (amount as original recipe is written). When veggies are vibrantly colored and beginning to soften — about 4 minutes — turn off the heat and add your kimchi and kimchi juice.

You should hear it sizzling and popping a bit. If it’s quiet, turn your heat up a little. After 2 minutes, toss your rice and add 1/4 cup (72 g) gochujang (amount as original recipe is written).
