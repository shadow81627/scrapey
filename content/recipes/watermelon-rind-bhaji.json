  "description": "This basic side dish is one of the best, tastiest ways to repurpose watermelon rinds. It&#x27;s quick to throw together, and perfect as part of a hurried weeknight dinner.Â ",
  "headline": "Watermelon Rind Bhaji",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Watermelon: A large watermelon (about 6 1/2 pounds) would yield about 2 pounds rind, so choose your fruit accordingly. If you have leftover rind, it can easily be repurposed into a pickle (see headnote). Storage: This is best eaten immediately, but leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 4 days."

Reduce the heat to medium and add 1 teaspoon black mustard seeds, followed quickly by 1 teaspoon cumin seeds, 1/2 teaspoon asafoetida, 1/2 teaspoon ground turmeric, and the chile. The spices will sputter and spit hot oil, so be careful!"

      "text": "In a few seconds, the spices will slightly darken in color. Add the watermelon rind, stir to coat in the spices, and spread into an even layer. Fry without flipping until the bottom is light golden brown, about 10 minutes. Flip the pieces and fry until the second side is golden-brown, 7 to 10 minutes more. Taste and season with kosher salt as needed. This is best eaten fresh plain or with a phulka or roti."
