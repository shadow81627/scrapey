    "1 1/3 cup / 233 g dairy free chocolate chips (, divided - plus a few more for decorating the top)",
    "1/4 cup / 4 tablespoons smooth seed or nut butter",
    "3/4 cup / 150 g sugar (, cane, granulated white or coconut sugar)",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "1/3 cup / 80 ml unsweetened milk of choice",
    "1 teaspoon fine salt",
    "1 1/4 cup / 125 g oat flour or all purpose flour (, for gluten-free be sure to use certified gluten-free oats)",
    "2 tablespoons ground flax seed (, don't sub this for anything else. It gives the best result by far. )",
    "1 teaspoon baking powder",
    "1/8 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda in the UK)",
    "1/3 cup / 20 g mini vegan marshmallows (, I like the brand Dandies )"

      "text": "To a small saucepan, add 1 cup (175 g) of the chocolate chips. Set the rest aside you will need them later. Then add the nut/seed butter, sugar, vanilla, milk and salt to the pan. Set over a really low heat and allow to melt together. Once the chocolate chips are a bit melty, take it off the heat and stir it together well until they melt completely and it looks like chocolate sauce."

Stir it to combine, then pour in the melted chocolate mixture, making sure you scrape the pan out well with a spatula so you don't waste any. Stir everything together until you can't see any dry flour."

      "text": "Stick an extra couple of chocolate chips and marshmallows in the top of each one, then bake on the centre shelf of the oven for 15 to 17 minutes. They will stay in mound shapes for most of the time in the oven, but towards the end will flatten to cookie shapes. Once done they will have firmed up a little on the edges and will look cooked but still feel very, very soft if you touch them gently."

      "text": "Remove from the oven and leave on the tray for 5 minutes. They will be too soft to move immediately. After 5 minutes, transfer them really gently to a cooling rack and allow to cool completely before storing in an air tight container. Eating one (or more) warm is highly recommended though!"
