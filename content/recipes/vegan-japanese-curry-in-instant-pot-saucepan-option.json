    "description": "Vegan Japanese Curry made in Instant Pot Pressure cooker. Saucepan Option\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/04/vegan-japanese-curry-in-instant-pot.html\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡BUY MY COOKBOOK: https://veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nIt is starting to warm up, but I love a bowl of spiced up veggie filled curry or soup any day. This GoldenJapanese Veggie Curry is amazingly good and lovely as a soup, over rice or however you want to serve it. \n\nRoast the onions and flour for a roux, add in the veggies, water and spices, all in a pot (Pressure cooker or a saucepan), simmer and done. If you have Japanese curry powder, use it (some can have additives, so read ingredients). Japanese curry powder is much more complex flavored compared to regular curry powder, and is more closer to garam masala + turmeric. I use my homemade garam masala with added turmeric in this recipe. I also use chickpeas instead of the chickin/meat, use other vegan chikin subs for variation. Add some roasted cashews, more beans or some tofu for more protein.\nVegan, glutenfree, nutfree Recipe. Can be soyfree, oil-free\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ’™ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \nMusic: That Girl by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/",
