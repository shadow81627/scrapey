  "description": "This is one of those salads that I like best unadorned, just the clean flavors of summer squash, onion, garlic, and lemon. But feel free to add fresh herbs or follow one of the variations listed at the end. And do make it a day ahead of time so that the lemon and vinegar have time to “cook” the zucchini.",
