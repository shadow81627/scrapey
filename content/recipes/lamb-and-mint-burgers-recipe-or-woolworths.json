    "1 tbs olive oil",
    "20g butter",
    "1 onion, finely chopped",
    "2 cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped",
    "1 fresh root ginger, grated (2.5 cm piece)",

      "text": "Put the lamb mince in a large bowl, then tip in the cooled onion mixture and the mint. Season again, then mix together until well combined - this is best done using your hands. Roll large balls of the mixture together, and flatten to make burgers. Sit the burgers on a plate, and chill in the refrigerator to firm, if time permits."

      "text": "Shallow-fry the burgers, a few at a time, in a little hot vegetable oil. Fry for 5-6 minutes on each side until cooked through and no longer pink. Alternatively, grill on a hot griddle, ridged cast-iron grill pan, or barbecue. Serve hot. These are delicious with some roasted butternut squash and wild rocket leaves."
