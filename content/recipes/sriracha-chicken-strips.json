    "1.5 lbs about 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts ($2.98)",
    "1/3 cup sriracha hot sauce ($0.49)",
    "1 Tbsp rice vinegar ($0.05)",
    "1 inch peeled and grated ginger ($0.11)",
    "1 clove garlic, minced ($0.06)",
    "1 large egg ($0.12)",

Fill the first with the all-purpose flour, in the second whisk the egg and 1 Tbsp of water and in the third bowl place the panko bread crumbs. Also get a clean plate or dish ready to hold the breaded chicken strips."

Make sure all surfaces of the chicken strip get covered with each. Gently place the breaded strip on the clean plate and move on to the next one. This is messy and your hands will get coated so make sure you wonâ€™t get interrupted before you begin."

      "text": "Once all of the strips are breaded, place them on a baking sheet lined with foil and bake for 20 minutes at 400 degrees. After 20 minutes, turn the oven on to broil and broil for about 5 minutes on each side. Watch the strips during the broiling process. When they get golden brown, pull them out, flip them and wait for the second side to get golden (about 5 minutes each side). Let the strips cool slightly before serving!"
