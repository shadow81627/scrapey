Either griddle or grill them for 2-4 minutes each side, until they are charred in places and cooked through. Put them on a large plate in a single layer to cool."

Leave in the fridge with a weight (such as a chopping board and some cans) on top for at least 4 hours, turning once. Unwrap and slice to serve, or transport in the wrapping and slice at a picnic."
