    "1/2 cup softened vegan butter (1 stick = 1/2 cup // or dairy butter if not vegan)",
    "2/3 cup organic cane sugar* (plus more for rolling)",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "3 Tbsp aquafaba",
    "1/4 cup salted creamy peanut butter",
    "3/4 tsp baking powder",
    "1 pinch sea salt (add 1/4 tsp if peanut butter is unsalted // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size)",
    "2/3 cup almond flour*",
    "1/4 cup cornstarch or arrowroot",
    "1 1/3 cup gluten-free flour blend*",
    "15-18 mini vegan peanut butter cups (such as Justinâ€™s brand)"

If too soft, continue adding 1 Tbsp each gluten free flour blend, almond flour, and cornstarch until a thick, moldable dough is formed. If it is too dry for some reason, add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) almond milk and stir. Then transfer dough to the refrigerator and chill for 15 minutes*."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Use a cookie scooper (I like this one) or Tablespoon to measure out 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts of dough and gently roll into balls - the dough will still be soft, so be gentle. Arrange on the parchment-lined baking sheets and press down gently with the palm of your hand to smash slightly (see photo). The cookies won't spread much, so don't worry about giving them too much room on the baking sheet."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Bake for 11-12 minutes or until the cookies appear fluffy and the edges are slightly beginning to dry out. Remove from oven and immediately press an unwrapped peanut butter cup down in the center of the cookies. Don't press too hard or it can crack too much. Be gentle - they only need to be inserted enough to stick in place. Let cool on baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely (expedite cooling time by transferring to refrigerator)."
