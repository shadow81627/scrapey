Strain the cashew milk through the lined strainer, pressing on the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. Twist the sides of the cheesecloth or fabric around the cashew pulp and squeeze out any remaining liquid; discard the pulp. Refrigerate in airtight containers or bottles for up to 3 days."
