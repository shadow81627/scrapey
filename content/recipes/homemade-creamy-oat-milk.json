Gently squeeze the bag until all of the milk is strained through. Make sure to squeeze the bag lightly, as squeezing it too much can make too much oat pulp leak through. Discard the pulp or use it in any of the ways listed in the recipe notes."

      "text": "Transfer the oat milk to a sealable container and pop it in the fridge. Use as desired. The oat milk will naturally separate as it sits so just give it a shake before using. Oat milk will keep fresh in the fridge for up to 5 days or longer. I do not recommend heating homemade oat milk as it will thicken due to the starches in the oats."
