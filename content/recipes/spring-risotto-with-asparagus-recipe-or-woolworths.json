Tip 1: Cooking the rice in the butter and oil mixture, until the grains are toasted and translucent, softens the outer starch layer of the rice and makes a creamier risotto. Tip 2: Leftover risotto can be cooled. Rolled into patties, dusted in rice flour or quinoa flakes, sprayed with oil and oven baked as risotto cakes for party food. Tip 3: Leftover risotto can be used to stuff large tomatoes or hulled zucchini halves and baked with a tomato pasta sauce and salad to serve."
