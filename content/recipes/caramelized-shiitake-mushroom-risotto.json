    "1 Tbsp coconut aminos (or tamari // soy sauce)",

Optional: remove some of the shiitake mushrooms from the pan and reserve for serving - not necessary, but it makes a nice garnish."

Hearty, flavorful, and incredibly satisfying.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/caramelized-shiitake-mushroom-risotto/\n\nRisotto is a rice-based dish that is believed to have originated in Milan, Italy. The first version was called Risotto alla Milanese and was traditionally made with butter, onion, white wine, stock, salt, saffron, and Parmesan. Since then, many flavor variations have been created. Our plant-based version is not traditional, but is dairy-free and equally delicious!\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
