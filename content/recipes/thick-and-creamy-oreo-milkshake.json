Give the container a squeeze — it shouldn’t be rock hard and should give slightly when it’s ready."

      "text": "Meanwhile, if you have room in your freezer, stick 2 tall drinking or milkshake glasses (about 12 ounces) in there, or else chill the glasses in the refrigerator. Chop 8 chocolate sandwich cookies into pieces no larger than 1/3-inch (about 1 cup). If you want cookies for garnish, finely chop 1 more cookie into crumbs no larger than a peppercorn."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Pour 2/3 cup milk into a blender. Add half of the chopped cookies and top with the softened ice cream. Starting on the lowest speed and working your way up to medium speed, blend for 30 seconds. Stir to break up any large chunks of ice cream and continue to blend on medium speed until the milkshake is smooth and pourable, 15 to 30 seconds more. You want a final consistency that pours like lava."
