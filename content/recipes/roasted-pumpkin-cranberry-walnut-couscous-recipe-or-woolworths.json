(while pumpkin is roasting) I add 1 teaspoon of olive oil to a pot and heat, add the 1 cup of pearl couscous and toast for 1-2 minutes, stirring constantly. Then slowly add 1 1/4 cup water, stir bring to the boil, then reduce heat and simmer with the lid on for around 10-12 minutes. The water will be all absorbed. I use a fork to separate grains once cooked. You can use vegetable stock if you want to add an extra layer of flavour."
