  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Be sure all of your ingredients are at room temperature, especially your cream cheese and butter. You want a cohesive batter with no lumps!If you find that your cookies lose their shape when you drop them into rounds, chill the dough for at least one hour. It may be too warm.Try other add-ins: lime or orange zest, a teaspoon of Cointreau or Sambuca, a pinch of cinnamon or nutmeg, or a scraped vanilla bean instead of extract.This recipe was originally published December 2010."
