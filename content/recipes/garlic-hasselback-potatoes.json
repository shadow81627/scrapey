      "text": "Use a sharp knife to cut thin slices about 1/4 -inch apart into a potato repeatedly working from one end to the other end, but not cutting all the way through the potato. You want to leave about 1/4 -inch of the potato intact along the bottom so that the slices hold together. It can be helpful to put two chopsticks on either side of the potato to stop you from cutting all the way through it, but be careful as this will only work in the middle of the potato where the bottom of the potato is touching the cutting board. For the ends, just go slow using a gentle sawing motion and make sure you don’t cut all the way through. Repeat with all the potatoes."

Bake for another 25 – 30 minutes until the potatoes are tender all the way through and golden brown on the outside. Serve with parsley for garnish. Leftover potatoes can be cooled and stored covered in the fridge for 3 – 4 days. Enjoy cold or you can reheat in the microwave, air fryer, or oven."
