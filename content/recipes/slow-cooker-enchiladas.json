Whisk in the flour, and as soon as it starts to bubble, whisk in the chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. Once mixed, whisk in the water and tomato paste. Raise the heat and bring the mixture to a boil. Lower heat and allow it to simmer for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally until it thickens up a bit. Remove the sauce from the heat and allow it to cool for a few minutes while you prepare the filling."
