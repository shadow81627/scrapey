      "text": "Heat the barbecue or charcoal grill until hot. Take each fillet steak and, using a thin pointed knife (a boning knife is perfect), pierce the side and move the knife from side to side to create a cavity, trying not to increase the size of the opening too much. Using your fingers, push a portion of the cream cheese into each opening. Do not overstuff."
