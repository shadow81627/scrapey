    "1/4 cup refined coconut oil, (melted)",

    "1 1/2 tablespoons kappa carrageenan (or substitute 2 tablespoons agar powder)",

      "text": "Add all of the ingredients to the blender, and blend until completely smooth and creamy. Kappa carrageenan must reach 158F to set. Because of this, it's very important that the water is at a full boil, that you add it to the blender last, and that you blend right away to ensure that nothing cools down. Quickly pour into your mold of choice, the cheese sets very fast so work quickly."

      "text": "Chill, uncovered in the fridge for about 1 hour or until the cheese sets and is firm all the way through. To remove the cheese just turn the mold over onto a clean surface and smack the bottom and sides a few times until it releases. Store the cheese in an air-tight container in the fridge up to 1 week, or it can be frozen."
