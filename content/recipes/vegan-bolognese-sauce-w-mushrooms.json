Cook it for about 12 minutes, stirring frequently. Once the pasta is cooked, drain it through a colander and toss it with 1 tablespoon of olive oil. This prevents the pasta from clumping together as it cools."

Transfer to a pot and sauté for about 3-4 minutes, stirring occasionally. Wipe down the food processor and add the mushrooms. Pulse a few times until mushrooms are broken down and resembled minced meat. Add them to the veggies and sauté for another 3-4 minutes until the mushrooms have cooked down in size."
