Tip 1: Run a sharp knife around the base of each shank to release the sinew before cooking. Tip 2: Meat from the left over shanks can be shredded and frozen with the risoni mixture for another meal. Tip 3: This recipe can be doubled and cooked in a large deep roasting pan covered tightly with 2 layers of foil."
