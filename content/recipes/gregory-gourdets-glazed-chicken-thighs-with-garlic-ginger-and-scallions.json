    "1/2 cup coconut aminos",
    "1 teaspoon arrowroot starch",
    "1/4 cup honey",
    "1/4 cup apple cider vinegar",
    "3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs",
    "1 tablespoon avocado oil",
    "1 1/2 tablespoons plus 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "10 medium scallions, trimmed and cut into 2-inch pieces, whites halved lengthwise",
    "10 large garlic cloves, thinly sliced",
    "1 moderately spicy fresh red chile, such as Fresno, thinly sliced",
    "3-inch knob ginger, peeled and cut into very thin matchsticks",
    "1 cup chicken stock, salted (homemade or store-bought)",
    "Handful small cilantro sprigs"

      "text": "Combine the coconut aminos and arrowroot starch in a small mixing bowl and whisk until the starch dissolves, including any clumps. Pour the mixture into a small saucepan, add the honey and vinegar, and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat to cook at a lively simmer until it's glossy and thick enough to lightly coat a spoon, about 1 minute. Set aside. The sauce keeps in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 3 weeks."

      "text": "Pat the chicken thighs dry, then lay them, skin-side down, on fresh paper towels to dry the skin especially well to prevent splattering. In a wide, heavy, ovenproof skillet that's at least 2 inches deep, heat the oil over high heat until shimmery. Working in two batches if need be, evenly season the chicken all over with 1 1/2 tablespoons of the salt and add the chicken, skin-side down, to the skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the skin is deep golden brown and crisp, 8 to 10 minutes. Flip the chicken and cook to give the bottoms a little color, about 3 minutes more, transferring the thighs to a plate as they're done."
