      "text": "Heat the sunflower oil in a large frying pan and fry the meatballs over a medium-high heat for about 3-5 minutes, turning to colour all sides, until golden and cooked through (cut one through to the centre to check there is no trace of pink). You may need to do this in batches, depending on the size of the pan. Serve."
