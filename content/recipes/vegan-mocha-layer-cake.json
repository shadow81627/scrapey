Heat while stirring constantly, just until the chips melt, being careful not to let the chocolate burn. Open up the cans of coconut cream and add just the solids. Stir until fully blended with the chocolate. You can put the pan back over low heat briefly if needed to help this along."

Scrape the mixture into a mixing bowl and beat it on high speed with an electric mixer until very light and fluffy. If the mixture is very dense you can add some non-dairy milk as you whip it, but just add a bit at a time, as it will get runny very quickly if you add too much."

Top with the third layer, also inverted, and use the remaining frosting to coat the top and outsides of the cake."
