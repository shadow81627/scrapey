In a bowl, beat the butter and sugar together with an electric hand whisk until pale and creamy, then beat in the eggs, one at a time, adding a little of the flour after each one. Stir in the rest of the flour and the milk - the mixture should drop easily off the beaters. Add the dried fruit and mix until well combined."
