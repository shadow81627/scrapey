Add the cauliflower and sunflower mixture and the spices and stir to combine. Add the beans and stir to combine. Squeeze the lime juice over the filling. Cook for approximately 15 minutes, or until the cauliflower is tender, not mushy. Turn off the heat and stir in the cilantro. It will wilt, but shouldn’t cook. If you don’t like cilantro, leave it out."
