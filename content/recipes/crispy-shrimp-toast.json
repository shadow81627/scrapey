Cook until the shrimp turns golden-brown, moving the toasts around the pan as needed so they brown evenly, 2 to 3 minutes. Carefully flip the toasts and cook until the bread is golden-brown, about 1 minute. Transfer to a paper towel lined-plate and sprinkle with kosher salt. Repeat cooking the remaining toasts. Garnish with thinly sliced scallions if desired and serve hot."
