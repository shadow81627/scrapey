    "description": "Almond or Peanut butter and chocolate fudge bars.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2016/08/chocolate-almond-butter-fudge-bars.html\n\nThese simple fudge bars use smooth almond or peanut or cashew butter, coconut butter and maple syrup. Warm up the coconut butter, then fold in the nut butter of choice and some maple. Mix until smooth and use two thirds of the mixture for the nut butter layer. Add in some chocolate or cocoa powder and make the chocolate layer. If you are up for it, you can make swirls and stuff on the top layer for prettier bars. These no Bake bars are Pb cups in bar form!\n\nThese might work well with sunflower seed butter for nutfree. Add flavors as vanilla or more cinnamon to taste.\nMy Books: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nMusic: Inselurlaub by Hanjo GaÌˆbler (Spanish Summer)",
