    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Cut your potatoes into medium sized chunks. You want them to all be similar sized so they have the same cook time. Place diced potatoes into a large pot and cover with cold water. I like to add a couple teaspoons of salt. Bring potatoes to a boil, turn down to a simmer and simmer until potatoes are fork tender, about 25 minutes. Drain potatoes and add them back into the pot and keep the lid on the make sure they stay warm."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Make the butter sauce while the potatoes are cooking. In a small saucepan, add the butter, milk, garlic and fresh herbs. Mix everything together and once butter has melted, keep heat on low and let everything simmer together for about 3-5 minutes, stirring often. Turn the heat off, put a lid on the pot and let sit for about 15 minutes."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Strain out the fresh herbs and garlic chunks from the butter mixture and then pour it over the cooked potatoes. Use a potato masher to mash the potatoes to desired texture and then mix everything together. Season with salt and pepper, to taste. Feel free to add extra butter or milk if you want the mashed potatoes to be on the saucier side!"
