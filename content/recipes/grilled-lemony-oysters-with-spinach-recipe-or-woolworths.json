      "text": "Melt the butter in a small saucepan until bubbling but not browned. Set a small heatproof bowl over a saucepan of simmering water, ensuring that the bottom of the bowl doesn’t touch the water. Add the egg yolks and a good squeeze of lemon juice and whisk together. Whisking continuously, very slowly start to add the melted butter. As the mixture starts to thicken, you can add the butter a little more quickly. When thickened, season and add more lemon juice to taste, the Worcestershire sauce and cayenne."
