      "text": "Use the bamboo mat to start rolling the nori up, tucking in the cucumber and salmon as you go. Once you have rolled up the majority of the nori, wet your finger and dampen the plain edge of nori. Finish rolling up the nori and the wet edge will stick the roll together. Repeat with the other nori sheet. Then, using a sharp knife, cut the rolls into 8 even pieces."
