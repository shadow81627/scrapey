    "description": "Chai Spice Tahini Cookies Nut free Oil-free Grain-free. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/12/chai-spice-tahini-cookies-nut-free.html\n\nThese Chewy and fudgy Tahini Cookies have tahini, sweetener, chai spice and coconut flour. They are vegan gluten-free grain-free nut-free soy-free and oil-free! \n\nThis year I have been experimenting a lot with tahini and grain-free baking! So here’s another tahini cookie which is mostly just tahini. The key to liking tahini is getting a good brand that is not too bitter. I love cookies which are scoop and bake, no hand messyness! These cookies bake into fat soft cookies. You can lave them like that or flatten with a spoon and continue to bake for crispy chewy cookies.\n\nFor these cookies, get a good brand of tahini such as Soom or Whole foods brand, add a lot more spice to mask some of the bitterness, adjust baking time for the kind of texture you prefer, a few mins longer for crispier and and get to a cookie you love! Don’t like tahini, just use smooth nut butter or sunbutter or use a a mix of tahini and nut butter.\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound\n#veganricha #easyveganreecipes #tahinicookies #vegancookies #grainfree",
