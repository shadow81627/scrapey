  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "While pie dough usually benefits from being refrigerated after it’s used to line the pie plate and crimped, if the caramelized crust is held in the fridge for too long, the sugar will start to get sticky. It’s best to limit refrigeration before baking to 40 minutes maximum.Make ahead: The tightly wrapped disk of dough can be refrigerated for up to 3 days. Wrapped in plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil, the dough can be frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight in the fridge before using. The pie can be baked and refrigerated up to 36 hours before brûléeing and serving.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container up to 2 days.Excerpted from THE BOOK ON PIE © 2020 by Erin Jeanne McDowell.

Use a tossing motion with your hands to start to mix the two together (this begins to combine them without creating too much gluten). As it begins to become hydrated, you can start to use more of a kneading motion – but don’t overdo it: this will make the dough tough."

Dough that is too dry may have sort of a “dusty” appearance, or pockets of un-hydrated flour. It will not hold together and will appear crumbly. Dough that is too wet will feel sticky or tacky to the touch, and is often smoother and/or lighter in color."

Use scissors to trim away the excess dough, leaving about 1/2-inch excess all the way around the outside edge of the pie plate. Tuck this excess dough under itself, pressing gently to make it flush with the edge of the pie plate. Crimp the edges as desired. Chill for 30 to 40 minutes."
