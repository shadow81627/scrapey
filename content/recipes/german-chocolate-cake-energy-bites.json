  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 1/4 cup raw pecans",
    "2/3 cup unsweetened shredded coconut",
    "3/4 cup packed pitted dates (measured after pitting // medjool are best // if especially dry, see notes)",
    "1/4 cup cacao powder or unsweetened cocoa powder",
    "1/4 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "2 Tbsp creamy almond butter (or other nut or seed butter)",
    "1/3 cup dairy-free semi-sweet chocolate chips",
    "1/2 tsp coconut oil"

      "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C). Add pecans to a bare baking sheet and toast for 7 minutes. Then add coconut and toast both together for 2-5 minutes until fragrant and lightly browned, watching closely and tossing/stirring after 2 minutes to ensure even cooking. Remove from the oven and let cool slightly. Transfer to a food processor and pulse a few times until no large pieces of pecans remain (see photo). In a small bowl, reserve 1/4 cup (30 g) toasted pecans and coconut for coating the exterior of the bites (adjust amount if altering the default number of servings)."

      "text": "Pulse the remaining pecans and coconut into a fine meal, then add pitted dates, cacao or cocoa powder, vanilla, salt, and almond butter. Pulse until the mixture is broken down and crumbly — we like to stop before it becomes completely dough-like so that the bites maintain some texture. It should stick together when pressed between two fingers; if still dry and crumbly, continue processing until it is sticky enough to form into a ball. If too dry, you can add a bit more almond butter — we didn't need any extra, though."

      "text": "“FROSTING”: To a small glass or metal bowl, add chocolate chips and coconut oil. Carefully place the bowl on top of a saucepan of simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally with a spatula or spoon, until melted and no lumps remain — ~5 minutes. You can also melt the chocolate and oil in a heat-proof bowl in the microwave in 20-second increments until melted. Remove chocolate mixture from heat."
