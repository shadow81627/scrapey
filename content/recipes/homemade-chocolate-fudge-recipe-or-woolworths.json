      "text": "Store fudge at room temperature loosely covered in a sealed container. We use the same baking paper that we cut up in squares to put layers between the fudge so they don't stick together and then put the container lid on. If it is really hot we do store ours in the refrigerator like this is a sealed container. Most of all enjoy as this is delicious and very cheap to make."
