    "2 cups fresh cranberries",
    "1 cup sugar, divided",
    "1/4 cup fruit juice (we used orange here, but you can use whatever you have on hand)",
    "5 Anjou or Barlett pears, slightly firm, peeled, cored and diced (about 5 cups)",

Add the coconut oil and pulse a few more times, until you get a cornmeal like consistency. Add the almond milk, 1 tablespoon at a time, and keep pulsing until the mixture comes together and form a dough (you might not need all 6 tablespoons). Refrigerate for 10 minutes"
