When the oil shimmers, wipe out the excess oil and place one tortilla in the pan. Reduce heat to medium and let cook for one minute. Flip the tortilla and cook for an additional minute while you add 2 tablespoons of sauce, spreading it all the way to the tortilla’s edge."

Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 2 to 4 minutes, or until the edges of the tortilla are golden brown but not burned (if you’re not using cheese, check on the early side). Transfer the pan back to the stove and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes over medium heat, until the bottom is browned, but not burned. Transfer the pizza to a plate and let it cool slightly. Top with fresh herbs, if using."
