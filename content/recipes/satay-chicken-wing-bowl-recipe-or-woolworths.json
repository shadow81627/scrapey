I used the same spice mix and marinated some prawns for a few hours in the satay spice mix then BBQ cooked then just before the chicken wings were cooked. Serve with your favourite satay sauce and oven roasted peanuts tossed in a sweet chilli salt glaze. This looks so cool in a massive stainless steel bowl. Enjoy!"
