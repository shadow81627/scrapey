(If you are using small, baby collards, cook at high pressure for only 1 minute.) Remove from heat and use a quick-release method to reduce the pressure. Check the collards for tenderness; if they’re still tough, put them back on the heat, but don’t seal the cooker. Cook until tender. Salt, if desired, with smoked salt and serve (using a slotted spoon) with additional red pepper flakes."
