Let it sit for 1 minute. Add the chocolate and let it sit for 1 more minute. Whisk until melted. Wait for the mixture to be warm to touch as some nut butters might separate when mixed in a hot mixture. Add in the almond butter and whisk and whisk until smooth using a hand mixer or whisk."

Let them chill for a few hours (this gives a great texture) before serving with a dollop of coco whip or vanilla ice cream."
