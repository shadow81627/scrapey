    "1 teaspoon dried basil",
    "1 teaspoon dried oregano",
    "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
    "1/2 teaspoon fennel seeds",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper",
    "1 teaspoon smoked paprika (, optional for smoky flavor)",
    "1/4 cup soy sauce",
    "1 cup oats (, gluten-free if needed (see note) )",
