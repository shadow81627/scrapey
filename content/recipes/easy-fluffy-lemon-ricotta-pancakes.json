    "description": "My husband and I disagree on many things when in comes to pancakes. He wants them plain and simple with nothing but a healthy hand of maple syrup. I, on the other hand, like adding things like blueberries or bananas to the equation. There is one point we agree on, though, and it's that the best pancakes are the fluffiest ones. That's why we're both extra enthusiastic about a stack of these lemon ricotta pancakes on a weekend morning. They're simple enough for the pancake purist, yet feel special enough, with their wisp of lemony flavor, for those, like me, who crave a little something extra. What's most important, however, is that they're easy.\n\nSee full post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/lemon-ricotta-pancakes-23003856)",
