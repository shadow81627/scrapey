Add a Tablespoon or more bread flour if needed, to get the dough together into soft not too sticky state.Cover with a towel and Let it rise in a warm place for an hour. You can refrigerate the dough at this point in a closed container. Take the dough out when you want to use it, keep in a warm 100 degree F oven for 10-15 minutes and continue. Take the dough out on the counter and use some bread flour to make it less sticky."

      "text": "You can knead it for 2-3 minutes if you dont like sticky messy dough. I usually just throw it on the counter and then gather. Then make a flat ball and pat it on the parchment. Roll it between 2 parchments after dusting with bread flour, or just pull it on all sides. The thickness of the dough will not be even with the pulling, but thats what gives it a hand made rustic feel. You can roll it to as large as 12 inches. The dough will be very elastic, so pull and hold it down for 10 seconds and then pull on opposite sides and so on. Once desired shape is achieved. Spray warm water on top. Cover lightly with a towel an let rest till you prep the veggies. Or go on ahead with the toppings if everything is ready!"
