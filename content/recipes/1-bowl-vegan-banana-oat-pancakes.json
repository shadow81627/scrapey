  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 medium ripe banana (brown and spotty preferred)",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp olive, avocado, or melted coconut oil (plus a little more for cooking)",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup (we recommend Grade A)",
    "2 tsp baking powder",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 - 1 1/4 cups non-dairy milk (we recommend plain unsweetened almond milk)",
    "3/4 cup gluten-free oat flour* (we recommend grinding from rolled gluten-free oats)",
    "3/4 cup gluten-free flour blend (we recommend our DIY blend for best results)",
    "1/4 cup almond flour (not almond meal // OR sub more gluten-free blend)",
    "1/4 cup vegan dark chocolate chips or fresh or frozen fruit, like wild blueberries or blueberries"

      "text": "To a mixing bowl, add banana and mash. Then add oil, maple syrup, baking powder, and salt and whisk to combine. Then add non-dairy milk (start with the lesser amount and work your way up as needed) and whisk to combine. If using coconut oil and it hardens or clumps, it's not a big deal. You can microwave (for 45 seconds - 1 minute) to remelt - otherwise, proceed."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add oat flour, gluten-free flour, and almond flour. Gently stir (being careful not to over-mix) to combine. It should be thick but pourable/scoopable. If too thin, add more gluten-free or almond flour. If too thick, thin with a little non-dairy milk. If adding fruit or chocolate chips, add now and gently fold to combine."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat a large nonstick skillet, griddle, or cast-iron skillet over medium heat. Carefully rub skillet with a little oil. (You will likely need to decrease the heat of the skillet to medium-low / low once it's hot as to not burn the pancakes.)"

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once hot, spoon 1/4 - 1/3 cup of the batter onto skillet. Cook until surface of pancakes have some bubbles and the edges appear dry (~2-3 minutes). Carefully flip pancakes and cook until browned on the underside (~3 minutes more). The gluten-free flour blend benefits from a slightly longer cooking time, so don’t be shy to get a nice golden brown color on both sides."

      "text": "Transfer cooked pancakes to a baking sheet or plate (don’t stack pancakes on top of one another) and keep warm in a 200-degree F (94 C) oven. Continue cooking until all batter is used up - about 12 pancakes (as original recipe is written)."
