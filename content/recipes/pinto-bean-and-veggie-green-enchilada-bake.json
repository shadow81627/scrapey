  "recipeIngredient": [
    "6 (6-inch) yellow or white corn tortillas",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil (if oil-free, sub water)",
    "1 small yellow onion, finely diced (1 small onion yields ~1 cup or 160 g)",
    "3 large cloves garlic, minced",
    "1 medium jalapeño or serrano pepper, finely diced (we used serrano for more heat)",
    "3/4 tsp sea salt (use less if your chili powder has salt in it)",
    "2 tsp chili powder blend (NOT chili flakes, cayenne pepper, or pure chili)",
    "4 cups fresh veggies of choice, finely diced (we used 1 cup zucchini, 1 cup carrots, and 2 cups baby spinach)",
    "1 (15-oz.) can pinto beans (or sub black beans), drained",
    "1 cup Easy Green Enchilada Sauce (or sub store-bought)",
    "Vegan sour cream (or avocado crema)",
    "Red onion (or shallot), diced",

Add the garlic, jalapeño (or serrano), salt, and chili powder. Toss to distribute the spices and sauté for another 1-2 minutes."

Stir frequently, until the vegetables have brightened in color and are beginning to soften, about 3-5 minutes. Add the drained pinto beans and mix once more to combine. Let the pinto beans warm through for ~2 minutes, then taste and adjust the filling, adding more salt for overall flavor or more chili powder for smokiness and heat."

Top the filling with 4 more tortilla halves, then another 1/3 cup (80 ml) sauce, and the rest of the filling.
