It can be prepared up to 3-4 days in advance or (our preferred method) stored in the freezer and reheated for quick weeknight-friendly meals. If using frozen, transfer them to the fridge 24 hours before serving or defrost in warm water or the microwave."

Drizzle with a little oil (if avoiding oil, omit and use parchment paper) and massage to coat. Place potatoes cut side down on the baking sheet. Bake for 25-35 minutes, or until caramelized on the edges and when you press on the top of the potatoes, they have a little give."
