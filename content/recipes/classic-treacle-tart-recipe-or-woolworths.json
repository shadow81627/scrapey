  "recipeIngredient": [
    "225g plain flour",
    "75g cold butter, cubed",
    "1 pinch salt",
    "25g butter, melted",
    "3-4 slices white bread, made into coarse breadcrumbs",

      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Make the pastry by placing the flour and butter in a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt. Using your fingertips, rub the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add a few drops of iced water, then use your hands to pull the pastry together until it comes away from the edge of the bowl. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and roll into a ball. Flatten slightly, wrap in cling film, and put in the refrigerator to rest for 20 minutes. Try not to handle the pastry too much or it will become tough."

      "text": "Roll the pastry out thinly and use to line the tart tin. Prick the base all over with a fork. Line the case with greaseproof paper, then fill with the baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15 minutes, or until very lightly golden. Remove the beans and paper, then put the tart case back in the oven for a few minutes to crisp up the base. Set aside while you make the filling. Turn the oven down to 190°C."

      "text": "Place the butter and breadcrumbs in a bowl and mix together with a fork until well combined. Add the syrup and stir until the mixture is smooth but quite stiff. Spoon into the pastry base and level the top. Bake in the oven for 10-15 minutes, or until golden and set. Do not overcook or the filling will become brittle: it should be soft and slightly chewy; the pastry thin and crisp. Leave to cool, then wrap in greaseproof paper followed by cling film, and freeze."
