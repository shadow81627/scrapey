Whip together for aother minutes, scraping down the sides as necessary. Add the applesauce and vanilla extra and mix until it is well incorporated. The dough may look a little curdled at this point. Thatâ€™s okay! It will sort itself out once the rest of the ingredients are added."

Once you add the flour, mix it until it just starts coming together. At that point, turn it out onto a floured work surface and bring it together with your hands. Transfer the dough to a piece of parchment paper, lightly dust with powdered sugar and top with another piece of parchment paper. Roll out to about 1/4\" thick. Refrigerate for 1 hour."

Keep the shapes as close together as possible. Return to the refrigerator for 30 minutes to let the dough reharden. Otherwise, your cookies will spread out too much in the oven."
