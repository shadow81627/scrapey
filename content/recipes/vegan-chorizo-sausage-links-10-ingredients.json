    "3 Tbsp flaxseed meal (ground flax seeds)",
    "1/2 cup water",
    "1 (15-oz.) can red kidney beans",
    "1 1/2 cups rolled oats (certified gluten-free as needed)",
    "1 cup cremini mushrooms, roughly chopped",
    "5 tsp chili powder blend (NOT chili flakes or cayenne pepper)",
    "5 tsp smoked paprika",
    "1/2 - 1 tsp cayenne (optional)",
    "3 Tbsp ketchup",
    "4 cloves garlic, minced (optional)",
    "1 tsp each sea salt & black pepper",
    "1/2 cup walnuts, finely chopped",
    "2 Tbsp avocado oil (for cooking)"

Then add the flax eggs, chili powder, smoked paprika, cayenne (optional, start with the lesser amount), ketchup, garlic (optional), and salt and pepper. Pulse to fully combine, but avoid processing it into too smooth of a paste — leave some chunks for texture. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as needed, more paprika for smokiness, or cayenne for heat. Transfer to a bowl and stir in the chopped walnuts until fully combined."

Using 2 tablespoons will make ~16 sausages, or you can also use a 1/3-cup measurement to make 8 sausages about 6 inches long (amounts as recipe is written // adjust if altering number of servings)."

      "text": "While your sausages chill, bring a few inches of water to a boil in a large pot with a steamer insert. Remove your sausages from the refrigerator and wrap each sausage in a small piece of parchment paper, twisting the ends to seal. Place sausages in the steamer basket and steam for 30 minutes, until firm and cooked through. Add more water at the 15-minute mark (or as needed) to avoid scorching your pot."

      "text": "If freezing for later, cool completely and transfer to the freezer. Otherwise, to cook and brown the sausages, heat a large cast iron skillet over medium heat and add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) oil to the pan. Remove the sausages from the parchment paper, add as many as will fit in the pan comfortably, and fry for 5-10 minutes, turning every once in a while until all sides are slightly browned. Repeat with more oil and sausages. You can also cook the sausages on a grill if desired!"
