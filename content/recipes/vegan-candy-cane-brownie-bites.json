    "1/4 cup brown rice flour (, I use a finely ground brown rice flour)",
    "1 tablespoon tapioca starch",
    "1/8 teaspoon baking soda",
    "1/4 teaspoon sea salt",
    "2 cups vegan chocolate chips (, divided into 1/2 cup, 1/2 cup and 1 cup portions)",
    "1/2 cup cashew butter (, room temperature (or tahini for nut free)",
    "6 Medjool dates (, soaked in hot water, plus 2 tablespoons of the soaking water)",
    "1 tablespoon molasses",
    "1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "1/2 teaspoon peppermint extract",
    "2-3 tablespoons crushed candy canes (, optional for topping)"

Pour melted chocolate into a piping bag used for frosting, or you can use a plastic bag and cut the corner off, make sure it isn’t too hot so you don’t burn yourself. Pipe the melted chocolate over the brownie bites so that it covers the entire top, it’s okay if it melts down the side. Messy is good."
