    "1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.16)",

    "1 yellow onion ($0.49)",
    "1 1/2 lb. ground beef ($6.09)",
    "2 cups black beans ($0.56)",
    "2 cups pinto beans ($0.56)",
    "1 recipe taco seasoning ($0.34)",
    "1 tsp salt ($0.05)",
    "12 oz. jumbo shells ($2.78)",

Once the beef is fully cooked through, add the taco seasoning and stir to combine. Drain the beans and add to the skillet. Stir until combined.

Spray the inside of a 9×13 inch casserole dish with non-stick spray. Fill the shells with the beef and bean filling and place in the casserole dish. It’s okay if they’re not aligned neatly or if they topple over and spill some filling, it will still be good."

Cook in the preheated oven for about 30 minutes or until the cheese is melted and everything is heated through (all ingredients are already cooked, so there is no real danger of undercooking here. You just want to get it all HOT)."
