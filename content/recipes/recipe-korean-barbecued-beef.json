  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Rib-eye is the traditional cut, but I actually prefer flank steak for this recipe. It must be sliced very thin, which your butcher should be able to do for you. If not, place the steak in the freezer until firm (but not completely frozen), about 2 hours. Using a very sharp knife, cut the steak using one swift motion (do not saw) into 1/8-inch slices. Alternately, you can also look for thinly sliced beef cut specifically for bulgogi, often at Asian grocers.I often use frozen white rice, either Trader Joe’s or P.F. Chang’s brand."
