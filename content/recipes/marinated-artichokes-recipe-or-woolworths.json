    "1 handful bay leaves",

    "0.5 cup flat-leaf parsley, chopped",

      "text": "Halve lemons, squeeze juice and place juice and squeezed halves into a large stock pot. Add 2L water. Remove small leaves from stalks and around the bases of the artichokes. Trim stalks to 6cm and peel off tough skin with a vegetable peeler. Using a bread knife, cut off the top 3cm from each. Rinse under running water, gently prising the layers open to allow the water to penetrate. Place into the stock pot along with bay leaves and half of the garlic. Top up with enough water to cover. Place an upturned plate or lid on top of the artichokes so they remain submerged."
