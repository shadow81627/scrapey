    "2 Tbsp olive oil",
    "1 small white or yellow onion, finely diced (1 small onion yields ~150 g or 1 cup)",
    "2 stalks celery, finely diced (2 stalks celery yield ~3/4 cup or 90 g)",
    "1 medium carrot, finely diced (1 medium carrot yields ~3/4 cup or 100 g)",
    "3 cloves garlic, finely minced",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1/2 tsp dried oregano",
    "1-2 chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (canned // adjust depending on your spice preference)",
    "1 Tbsp adobo sauce (from a can of chipotle peppers in adobo)",
    "2 (14.5-oz) cans fire-roasted diced tomatoes",
    "2 1/2 cups water",
    "3/4 cup canned full-fat coconut milk",

Add the celery and carrots, and stir to combine. Turn the heat to medium and sauté for 4-5 minutes, or until the veggies are fragrant and brightened in color."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Turn off the heat and use an immersion blender to purée the soup (or if using a regular blender, let the soup cool for at least 10 minutes first to avoid an explosion). Using a high-speed blender will give you a smoother soup! But we don’t mind the slight texture the immersion blender leaves behind."

      "text": "Once the soup is blended, add the coconut milk and return the soup to a slight simmer, just to heat it through. Enjoy warm! It’s delicious served with grilled \"cheese\" sandwiches, vegan \"tuna\" melts, or garlic bread. Optionally, garnish with swirls of coconut milk and adobo sauce (if you like it extra spicy!) and Chili Lime Roasted Pepitas."
