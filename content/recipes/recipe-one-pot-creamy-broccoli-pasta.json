    "description": "After working my way through our new collection of one-pot pasta recipes, I finally realized what so many of you have known all along: They're completely and utterly magical. Since the pasta boils directly with the sauce ingredients and soaks everything up as it cooks, the resulting dish is even more flavorful than I ever imagined. I'll be honest with you: I was always a little dubious of the one-pot pasta method. I mean, I can't argue with the convenience factor, but I assumed the vegetables would be overcooked or the sauce would be watery. But boy was I wrong. My latest favorite is this family-friendly mix of al dente shells and crisp-tender broccoli, coated in a thick and creamy (but not at all heavy) sauce, thanks to one surprising ingredient.\n\nSee full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/broccoli-pasta-266013)",
