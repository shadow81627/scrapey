Heat a heavy non-stick frying pan, add a few drops of oil, and wipe it around the pan with kitchen paper. Drop dessert spoonfuls of the batter into the hot pan; they should be 5cm wide. Cook over a medium heat for 1-2 minutes until bubbles form and the base is golden. Flip and cook for 1 minute. Repeat to make 35-40 blinis. Serve warm with the cucumber, smoked trout, and soured cream."
