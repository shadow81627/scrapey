      "text": "Beat aquafaba with an electric beater for 8 minutes on high speed until firm peaks form. Gradually add caster sugar, 1 tbs at a time, beating well after each addition until sugar has dissolved and mixture is well combined. Meringue should be glossy and thick. Add 1 tsp vanilla bean paste and cream of tartar and beat on high until combined. Spoon mixture into marked circles and spread evenly. Bake for 2 hours or until meringue feels crisp. Turn oven off and leave meringues in oven to cool completely with door closed."

Add icing sugar and remaining vanilla and gently whisk until soft peaks form. Do not over beat or mixture will be grainy. Spoon half the cream onto one pavlova disc and top with half of the raspberries and half of the pistachios. Place remaining pavlova disc over filling and top with remaining cream, raspberries and pistachios. Serve immediately. Note: While every care has been taken to ensure this recipe is vegan, always check labels as ingredients differ from brand to brand."
