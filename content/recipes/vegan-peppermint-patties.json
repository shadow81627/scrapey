Shake off excess chocolate then return the patty to the parchment lined baking sheet. I found using two forks, one in each hand, was the easiest method for dipping. If the patties start to soften before you finish coating them with chocolate, return the tray to the freezer to chill as needed. Once finished and all of the patties are chocolate coated, pop the tray back in the freezer set for about 10 minutes until the chocolate is completely set."
