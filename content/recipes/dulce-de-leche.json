  "description": "This one-ingredient dulce de leche recipe gets its beautiful brown color from the caramelization of sweetened condensed milk. ",
  "headline": "Dulce de Leche",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Type of can: After researching other recipes, we noticed that some people have reported issues with cans that open with a tab. For this reason, we recommend starting with a can of sweetened condensed milk that requires a can opener.Storage: Any leftover dulce de leche should be removed from the can with a utensil sprayed lightly with cooking spray (this helps prevent the dulce de leche from sticking during the transfer) and refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 1 month. It can also be frozen for up to 3 months with a layer of plastic wrap pressed onto the surface."
