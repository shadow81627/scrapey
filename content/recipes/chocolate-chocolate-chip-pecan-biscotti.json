      "text": "In a large mixing bowl, whisk the dry ingredients together and make a well for the wet ingredients. Pour the orange extract, vanilla and the aquafaba into the well and stir until just combined. Add the pecans and chocolate chips and stir until combined. Make sure your hands are clean and begin kneading the dough until the flour is fully incorporated and it forms a ball. If the dough is too crumbly, the flour may be too dehydrated. Add a tbsp of water at a time until the dough forms a solid ball. You don’t want it to be wet, just pliable."

For best results use a sharp serrated knife and gently saw through the log. Don’t press to hard or you may crack the log. Patience is key! Lay the cookies flat on the cookie sheet and bake for approximately 20 more minutes or until lightly golden brown and firm."
