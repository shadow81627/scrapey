Line a 12-hole medium muffin tin with larger pastry circles, pressing into the base and allowing the top edges to overhang. Fill with chicken mixture. Brush the pastry edges with a little egg. Top with smaller pastry circles and seal well, crimping the edges together. Brush tops with egg and cut slits in the top to allow steam to escape. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden and crisp.
