Place a bamboo skewer on each side of potato to prevent the knife from going all the way through when slicing. Using a sharp knife, slice potato vertically into 3mm slits. Repeat with remaining potatoes. Place potatoes on a large baking tray lined with baking paper, then drizzle with oil and season. Bake for 40 minutes or until golden and tender."
