    "text": "Pizza oven instructions: For a pizza oven, brush each dough round with 1 tablespoon of the garlic oil, then top with the mozzarella, vegetables, and feta. Bake in a 800ºF pizza oven until the bottom is charred in a few spots and the cheese on top is melted (you may have to turn the heat down if the crust is charring too quickly), rotating a few times for even cooking, 2 1/2 to 3 minutes total. Gently brush with the remaining garlic oil and top with torn basil leaves.Regular oven instructions: For a regular oven, place an upside-down baking sheet or pizza stone on the middle rack and heat the oven to 450ºF. Stretch the dough rounds out on individual sheets of parchment paper. Brush each dough round with 1 tablespoon of the garlic oil, then top with the mozzarella, vegetables, and feta. Bake one at a time: Slide, still on the parchment, onto the hot baking sheet or stone. Bake until the edges are golden-brown and the cheese on top is melted, 10 to 12 minutes. Gently brush with the remaining garlic oil and top with torn basil leaves.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."
