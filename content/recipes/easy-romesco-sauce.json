    "2 medium red bell peppers, left whole",
    "4 Tbsp slivered or flaked almonds (if avoiding almonds, try another nut or seed)",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil (if avoiding oil, sub water)",
    "2 Tbsp lemon juice",
    "2 cloves garlic, roughly chopped",
    "1/4 heaping tsp sea salt (plus more to taste)",
    "1/4 tsp red chili flake (reduce or omit for less heat, but it does help balance the sweetness)"

      "text": "Heat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 C) and line a baking sheet with foil (avoid parchment paper, which will burn and disintegrate at higher temps). Roast for about 20 minutes, or until nearly blackened on all sides. (Alternatively, roast your pepper over an open flame on a grill or gas stovetop until tender and charred on all sides — about 5 minutes). Then wrap in foil to steam for a few minutes (this will help the skin come off more easily)."

      "text": "Use immediately, or store in the refrigerator up to 5-7 days. Freezer safe up to 1 month, but best when fresh. Delicious on things like poached eggs or hummus over avocado toast, vegan scrambles, roasted vegetables, pasta, and more."
