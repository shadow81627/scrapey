  "description": "Arame lends a light seafood flavor to the cakes. If you can’t find it, other types of seaweed can be used, but be careful because some, such as wakame, can have a much stronger fishy flavor.",

    "1/2 cup hot vegetable broth",

    "1 teaspoon chia seed or ground flaxseeds",
    "14 ounces extra-firm tofu (, drained well)",
    "1 tablespoon nutritional yeast",
    "2 tablespoons lite soy sauce or gluten-free tamari",
    "2-3 tablespoons green curry paste (use even less if you’re using store-bought paste or don’t like things too spicy)",
    "1/2 cup quinoa flakes or quick oats (see notes below)",
    "1/4 cup finely diced red bell pepper",
    "1/4 cup minced parsley or cilantro",

Use a spatula to lift the cake from the plate onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Repeat for remaining tofu mixture.
