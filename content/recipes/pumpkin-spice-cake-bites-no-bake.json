  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 1/2 cups pitted dates (we prefer medjool dates // if dry, soak in warm water for 15 minutes, then drain and pat dry)",
    "1 1/2 cups walnuts",
    "3/4 cup rolled oats (certified gluten-free as needed)",
    "1/2 cup almond flour",
    "1 3/4 tsp cinnamon",
    "3/4 tsp nutmeg",
    "1/2 tsp ginger",
    "1/2 tsp allspice (optional)",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "2 Tbsp pumpkin purée",
    "3 Tbsp coconut butter",
    "2 tsp orange zest (about 1/2 an orange, zested)"

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Next, add the walnuts, oats, almond flour, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, allspice (optional), and salt. Pulse until very fine crumbs appear. Add the vanilla and pumpkin purée. Add a spoonful of date paste at a time pulsing to incorporate. Repeat until all of the date paste is used. Taste and adjust the level of spice to your preference, adding more vanilla for cakey flavor, more cinnamon for warmth, or more ginger for spice!"

      "text": "Scoop out 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts (we love this scoop) and roll into balls. Repeat until all of the dough is used. For best texture, we recommend placing the bites on a parchment-lined baking sheet or plate and placing in the refrigerator to chill for at least 30 minutes (or 15 in the freezer)."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "GLAZE: If using the optional glaze, prepare it once the bites have chilled. Add 1 inch of water to a small saucepan and bring to a low boil over medium heat. Once boiling, reduce heat to low and place the coconut butter in a small heat-proof bowl (we prefer glass). Carefully place the bowl on top of the saucepan of simmering water. Heat, stirring occasionally with a spatula or spoon, until melted and loose (~2 minutes). You can also melt the glaze in a heat-proof bowl in the microwave in 20-second increments until melted."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Using a small spoon, carefully place some melted coconut butter on top of each of the bites, letting it run down the sides slightly. Alternatively, dunk each bite into the glaze and roll around until all sides are coated. Use a fork to tap off excess glaze, then transfer back to your parchment-lined plate or baking sheet. While the glaze is still tacky, sprinkle orange zest evenly over all the bites."
