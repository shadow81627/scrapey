  "recipeIngredient": [
    "4 medium (~1/3 lb each) sweet potatoes*",
    "1 15-ounce can chickpeas (rinsed and drained)",
    "1/2 Tbsp olive oil",
    "1/2 tsp each cumin, coriander, cinnamon, smoked (or regular) paprika",
    "1 pinch sea salt or lemon juice (optional)",
    "1/4 cup hummus (or tahini)",
    "1/2 medium lemon, juiced (1/2 lemon yields ~1 Tbsp juice)",
    "3/4 - 1 tsp dried dill (or sub 2-3 tsp fresh per 3/4-1 tsp dried)",
    "3 cloves garlic, minced (3 cloves yield ~1 1/2 Tbsp or 9 g)",
    "Water or unsweetened almond milk (to thin)",
    "Sea salt to taste (optional // I didn’t need any)",
    "1/4 cup cherry tomatoes (diced)",
    "1/4 cup chopped parsley (minced)",
    "2 Tbsp lemon juice",
    "Chili garlic sauce"

Taste and adjust seasonings as needed. Add more garlic for more zing, salt for savoriness, lemon juice for freshness, and dill for a more intense herb flavor. I found mine didn’t need anything else."
