You can cook the lentils and potatoes in the Instant Pot with PIP(pot in pot method), see recipe notes on the post, or in separate pots and make ahead. I like my pie on the wet side, use less or more of the gravy with the lentils to preference. Add seasonal veggies or other root vegetables. Comfort food for any season. \n\nGluten-free Nut-free Recipe. Can be soy-free oil-free.
