Add the egg and beat on medium speed until combined. With the mixer on the lowest speed, beat in 2 cups all-purpose flour just until a streak or two of flour remains.

Sprinkle with about 4 teaspoons red sanding sugar while still wet. If your cookies have a hole in the center, like a wreath, use a toothpick to dislodge any glaze that settles there. Let the cookies sit until the glaze is set, about 15 minutes."
