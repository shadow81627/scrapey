      "text": "Add the quinoa and water to a medium saucepan set over high heat. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and cover. Simmer until the quinoa is mostly cooked through but still on the undercooked side, 15-20 minutes. The water will have absorbed but the quinoa won't quite be translucent. Meanwhile, set a small saucepan over medium heat and add the rice vinegar, honey and salt. Bring just to a simmer and keep warm until the quinoa is ready. Pour the vinegar mixture into the pan with the quinoa, stir well, cover and let sit until the quinoa absorbs the liquid. Remove the quinoa from the heat and let it cool completely."

      "text": "To assemble the sushi rolls, lay the bamboo mat on a flat surface and spread a piece of plastic wrap over the top. Lay one sheet of Nori on top of the plastic wrap. Spread 1/3 of the quinoa on top of the Nori, leaving a slight border at the edges. In the center of the quinoa, arrange 1/3 of the filling ingredients starting with the avocado, followed by cucumber, then the beets, and ending with the sprouts or microgreens."

      "text": "To roll, start with the end closest to you. Using the bamboo mat for help, bring the end up and tightly roll over the filling, pressing as you go. Press the edges together to seal. If edges are not sealing well, dip your fingers in a bowl of water and gently wet the edges of the Nori, then try again. With a very sharp knife, cut the sushi into 6-8 slices. Serve with the dipping sauce. Leftovers keep refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 2 days."
