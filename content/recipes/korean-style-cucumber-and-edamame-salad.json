  "description": "This edamame-enriched version of Korean cucumber salad is hot and spicy and sesame-infused. Delicious as a side dish or on rice in bi bim bap. I used young cucumbers that had very small seeds. If you’re using larger cukes with tough seeds, use 3 cucumbers and remove the seeds before slicing.",
