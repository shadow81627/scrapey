  "description": "This one-pot, hearty Vegan Irish Stew is so flavourful and can be made on the stove, in an Instant Pot, or in a slow cooker. Vegan-friendly Guinness gives an incredibly rich, deep flavour to the gravy and it&#039;s loaded with chunky, sweet, tender vegetables.  Make it with just veg, or add some optional vegan &quot;meat&quot; or mushrooms to make it even more satisfying and flavourful!",

I like to wait until the potatoes are really soft and just starting to break down before I serve. It will take about 45 to 50 minutes, but you can leave it simmering away much longer if you want to. Just turn it down to low and cover with a lid if it's going to be significantly longer."
