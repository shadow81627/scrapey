      "text": "The peaches need peeling for this recipe. Do this by cutting a cross on their base, blanching them in boiling water for a couple of minutes, then dunking them in ice-cold water. The skins will peel off easily. Make sure you start the peach jam first as it takes longer and, while it’s cooking, prepare the blackberry jam. That way the jars won’t cool too much before you pour in the second jam."
