The sweet and warmly spiced pie-style filling stands alone without the crutch of the crust. But even if your highway exit doesn't have the rocking chair-flanked brown barn and country-kitsch retail store, you can make a hot skillet of fried apples in less time than it takes to beat me in a round of checkers.",
