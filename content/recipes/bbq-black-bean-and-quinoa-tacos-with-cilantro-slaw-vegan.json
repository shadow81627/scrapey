    "2 small cloves garlic, minced",
    "1 cup marinara sauce",
    "1 tablespoon ketchup",
    "1 tablespoon pure maple syrup",
    "2 teaspoons apple cider vinegar",
    "1 teaspoon tamari",
    "1/2 teaspoon mustard powder",
    "1 teaspoon chili powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1/4 teaspoon salt",
    "1/8 teaspoon black pepper",
    "Corn tortillas for serving",
    "4 cups shredded green cabbage*",
    "3 cups shredded purple cabbage",
    "1 heaping cup shredded carrots",
    "1/3 cup chopped cilantro",
    "3/4 cups non-dairy mayonnaise (I use Just Mayo and it’s so good!)",

While quinoa is cooking, add all slaw vegetables to a large bowl. Mix the remaining slaw ingredients together in a medium sized bowl and then pour over the vegetables. Mix with a spoon or your hands until the vegetables are evening covered with sauce and refrigerate until needed."

      "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add the olive oil and shallot. Saute for a few minutes until shallot becomes tender. While the shallots are cooking, add all the remaining ingredients, excluding the garlic, to a small bowl (you can add them one by one to the pan but I find it easier and less stressful to add them all to one bowl while the shallots cook). Add the garlic to the pan and cook for another minute. Next, add all of the remaining ingredients (that you’ve already added to one bowl) and cook for about 5 minutes on low heat stirring occasionally."
