Drizzle with 2-3 teablespoons olive oil and season with cumin, paprika, garlic and salt and pepper (to taste). Mix together with your hands and roast zucchini until softened and browned, about 30 minutes."

      "text": "Add about 1/2 cup of enchilada sauce to the bottom of a large baking dish and spread it around to make sure the bottom is fully coated. You will want to heat your corn tortillas a little bit before folding up the enchiladas. I like to just heat mine in a pan over medium heat with a little bit of cooking spray. You could also use the microwave."

      "text": "Lay your heated corn tortilla on a cutting board and add 1-2 scoops of the zucchini mixture. Use your hands to gently roll up the tortilla, trying to contain all the filling. Place enchilada in the baking dish and repeat until you have used up all your enchilada filling."
