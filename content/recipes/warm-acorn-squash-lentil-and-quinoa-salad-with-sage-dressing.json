Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle sea salt and black pepper over them. Roast for approximately 40 minutes or until they begin to caramelize and can be pierced with a fork. They should be firm enough to cut into cubes. Let cool until you can cut the squash into cubes. Make sure cut the meat of the squash away from the skin."

When the lentils are done add the chopped spinach to the pan, stir, and cover so the spinach wilts."
