  "description": "A light and simple alfredo sauce that's butter- and cream-free, and packs a ton of flavor thanks to fresh garlic, parmesan cheese and a spoonful of pesto. A ciabatta roll makes the perfect companion to this dish with its light and fluffy texture - but feel free to substitute baguette or another style of bread if you don't have it on hand.",
