  "description": "This twist on mofongo, the Puerto Rican dish of mashed fried plantains cooked in garlic and mixed with crunchy pork rinds or chicharrón, also features potatoes. The buttery richness of the potatoes pairs perfectly with the slight sweetness of the plantains.",
  "headline": "Mashed Mofongo",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Plantains: Do not over fry plantains — you want them to be soft and fork tender, not crispy and hard. The best way to ensure this is making sure that your plantain slices are thick enough (at least 1 inch). For a “crunchy” texture to your mashed mofongo, soak sliced plantains in salty water for about 15 minutes. Drain and pat dry with a paper towel. Soaking in water before frying helps the plantains get crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside.Vegan or vegetarian: Omit the pork rinds. Swap the butter and heavy cream for plant-based dairy alternatives. Make ahead: The mashed potatoes can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat before adding in the plantains.Storage: Leftover mashed mofongo can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 2 months. Thaw frozen mashed mofongo before reheating. Reheat in a 350ºF oven until the potatoes reach 165ºF, 20 to 30 minutes. "
