  "description": "If you don't have the time (or the foresight) to soak the oats the night before, you can grind the oats into a fine powder before blending them into the smoothie. Use gluten free oats if necessary for a totally gluten free smoothie. This recipe calls for lite coconut milk, but feel free to use full fat for a more decadent smoothie. I like drink about a third of this smoothie immediately and pour the restÂ back into the 500ml jar the oats were soaking in and save that portion for after my workout.",
