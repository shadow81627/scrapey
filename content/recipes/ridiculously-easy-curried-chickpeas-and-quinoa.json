  "description": "A high-quality curry powder is essential here because weâ€™re relying on it for most of the seasoning. My favorite is Maharajah blend, which is fresh and flavorful but not hot. If you use a mild curry powder such as Maharajah, you can add as little or as much red pepper as you like to adjust the heat.",
