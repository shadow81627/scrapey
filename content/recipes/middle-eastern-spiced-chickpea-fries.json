Once the oil is hot enough (it should sizzle the second a fry is put in the pan), add about 8 fries to the pan. Cook until they are golden brown and crispy on the outside, about 3-4 minutes. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining fries. Sprinkle with aleppo pepper and serve immediately."
