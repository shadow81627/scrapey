    "1/2 cup vegan egg (, either chickpea flour recipe or store bought vegan egg)",

    "1/4 cup protein of choice (, I used my vegan bacon (optional)",

      "text": "In a small omelet pan (6 or 8 inches), saute veggies with drizzle of oil, or broth, and salt and pepper if using. I add the greens last. Add the protein here if it needs to be cooked. Set aside. A trick I use is to add the cheese here. Dairy free cheese tends to take longer to melt so if you warm it with the cooked veggies it will melt better."
