If you will be baking the frittata in the cast iron skillet, pour the egg mixture directly over the cooked chorizo and kale. If you are cooking the frittata in a casserole dish, spray it lightly with non-stick spray, add the cooked chorizo and kale to the bottom, and then pour the egg mixture over top."
