  "description": "Fingerling potatoes are braised in a broth flavored lightly with tomato and saffron and heavily with smoked paprika, becoming a thick, smoky sauce.I buy fingerlings in bags that are made up of several different varieties and sizes, some two or three times larger than the smallest ones. To make sure they cook in the same length of time, I cut the largest ones in half width-wise.",
