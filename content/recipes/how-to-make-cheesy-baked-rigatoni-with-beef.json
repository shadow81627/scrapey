  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: The unbaked casserole can be prepared up to 2 days in advance, covered with aluminum foil and refrigerated. When ready to bake, remove from the refrigerator while the oven heats. Uncover and add 5 to 10 minutes additional baking time.Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days.Ingredient variations. Ground turkey or Italian sausage can be substituted for the ground beef. Baking from frozen: If you plan to bake the casserole straight from the freezer, assemble it in a metal or disposable foil baking dish. Let the unbaked casserole cool completely in the pan, then wrap tightly in aluminum foil and freeze for up to 2 months.Bake the casserole, still wrapped in the foil, at 350ºF until heated through and an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F in the center. For a frozen casserole, this will take 1 hour 45 minutes to 2 hours. For a thawed casserole (thaw overnight in the refrigerator), this will take about 1 hour. Whether baking from frozen or thawed, bake uncovered for the last 15 minutes so the cheese can brown."
