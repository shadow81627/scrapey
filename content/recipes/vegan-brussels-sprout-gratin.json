    "24 oz Brussels sprouts (trimmed and halved)",
    "2 and 1/2 tbsp olive oil (divided)",
    "2 shallots (thinly sliced)",
    "4 cloves garlic (minced or grated)",
    "3/4 tsp salt",
    "1 batch cashew mozzarella (salt and garlic excluded; prepared up to the cooking step)",
    "1/2 cup panko-style breadcrumbs (gluten-free if needed; check labels for dairy ingredients)",
    "1/4 tsp dried oregano",
    "1/4 tsp dried thyme",
    "1/8 tsp ground black pepper",
    "1 tbsp nutritional yeast (optional)"

Bake for about 10-11 minutes, or until just starting to get tender (they will cook more after the other ingredients are added). Remove from the oven."
    },

      "text": "Meanwhile, blend the cashew mozzarella ingredients if you have not yet. Then, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to a saucepan over medium-low heat. Add the shallot, garlic, and salt, and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the shallot is translucent but not browned, 5 to 7 minutes."

      "text": "Add the blended cashew mozzarella mixture to the pan, and stir well. Increase the heat to medium. Continue to cook, stirring very frequently, until the mixture starts to thicken and get lumpy, and then becomes smooth again. Add the mixture to the pan with the Brussels sprouts. Depending on the size and shape of your pan and sprouts, you might not need all of it - add enough to submerge all of the Brussels sprouts but not more than that. Gently stir together."

      "text": "Whisk together the breadcrumbs, 1 tablespoon olive oil, and the oregano, thyme, black pepper, nutritional yeast if using, and a healthy pinch of salt. Sprinkle the breadcrumbs evenly on top of the baking dish. Bake for about 15 more minutes, or until nicely browned, rotating the dish partway through for even browning. Best served hot."
