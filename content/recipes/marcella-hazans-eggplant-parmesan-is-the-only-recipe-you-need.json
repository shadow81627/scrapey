    "text": "Ahead-of-time note: Eggplant Parmesan tastes best shortly after it has been made, but if you must, you can complete it from several hours to 2 or 3 days in advance. Refrigerate under plastic wrap when cool. Warm it up on the top-most rack of a preheated 400°F oven.Excerpted from Essentials of Classic Italian Cooking: A Cookbook by Marcella Hazan.

    "3 pounds eggplant",
    "Salt",
    "Vegetable oil",
    "Flour spread on a plate",
    "2 cups canned imported Italian plum tomatoes, well drained and chopped coarse",
    "1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil",
    "3/4 pound fresh mozzarella cheese, preferably buffalo-milk mozzarella",
    "8 to 10 fresh basil leaves",
    "An oven-to-table baking dish, approximately 11 inches by 7 inches or its equivalent",
    "Butter for smearing and dotting the dish",
    "1/2 cup freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese"

Stand one layer of slices upright against the inside of a pasta colander and sprinkle with salt. Stand another layer of slices against it, sprinkle with salt, and repeat the procedure until you have salted all the eggplant you are working with. Place a deep dish under the colander to collect the drippings and let the eggplant steep under salt for 30 minutes or more. Before cooking, pat each slice thoroughly dry with paper towels."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Choose a large frying pan, pour enough oil into it to come 1 1/2 inches up the sides, and turn the heat up to high. When you have dried the eggplant thoroughly with paper towels, dredge the slices in the flour, coating them on both sides. Do only a few slices at a time at the moment you are ready to fry them, otherwise the flour coating will become soggy. After coating with flour, fry the eggplant, by slipping as many slices into the pan as will fit loosely without overlapping. Cook to a golden brown color on one side, then turn them and do the other side. Do not turn them more than once. When both sides are done, use a slotted spoon or spatula to transfer them to a cooling rack to drain or to a platter lined with paper towels. Repeat the procedure until all the eggplant is done. If you find the oil becoming too hot, reduce the heat slightly, but do not add more oil to the pan."

Repeat the procedure, ending with a layer of eggplant on top. Sprinkle with grated Parmesan, and place the dish in the upper third of the preheated oven."

Check after it has been in the oven for 20 minutes by pressing down the layered eggplant with the back of a spoon, and draw off any excess liquid you may find. Cook for another 15 minutes, and after taking it out allow it to settle for several minutes before bringing it to the table."
