    "1/4 cup + 2 tbsp maple syrup",

    "1/4 cup vegetable oil (I used grapeseed oil)",
    "2 tbsp refined coconut oil",
    "3 tbsp unsweetened applesauce",
    "1/4 cup plain, unsweetened non-dairy milk",
    "1 and 1/2 tbsp tapioca flour (or cornstarch)",
    "1 and 1/2 tbsp instant coffee",
    "1/2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1/4 tsp almond extract",
    "3/4 cup all-purpose flour",

      "text": "In a separate bowl, with a whisk or fork, vigorously stir together all of the listed wet ingredients (including the tapioca starch, which I realize is dry, but it needs to be mixed in with the wet). Continue whisking/stirring until wet ingredients are completely emulsified and take on a smooth, dark appearance. Add the wet ingredients to the dry and mix to combine everything. Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees Fahrenheit and lightly grease a baking sheet."

      "text": "Shape the dough into balls approximately 2 tablespoons in size and line up on the baking sheet. For flatter, slightly chewier cookies like the one pictured below, flatten them down onto the baking sheet at this time. For puffier cookies like the ones pictured above, leave in the ball shape. Bake for 9-12 minutes, or until the edges start to crisp up and the middle feels firm; this will depend on what shape you choose. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before eating."
