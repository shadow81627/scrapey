    "text": "Filling substitutions: Not in the mood for turkey? Use sliced chicken or ham instead, or try a combination. Don’t eat pork? Bust out the turkey bacon. For a vegetarian version, try swapping the deli meat for cheese slices (fully dairy or plant based) and crisp up some veggie bacon.Make ahead: The bacon can be cooked several hours to several days ahead and refrigerated. Let come to room temperature before assembling the sandwiches."
