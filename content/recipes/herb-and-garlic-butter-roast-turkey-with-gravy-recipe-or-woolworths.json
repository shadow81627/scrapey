Bake, uncovered, for 3 hours, basting every 30 minutes with pan juices, or until well browned and juices run clear when thickest part of thigh is pierced with a skewer. Transfer turkey to a large platter. Loosely cover and rest for 10 minutes. Strain pan juices into a heatproof jug. Return 1/4 cup pan juices to roasting pan. Add remaining butter mixture and place pan over high heat. Add flour and cook, stirring, for 1 minute or until mixture bubbles. Gradually add remaining Campbell’s Real Stock Chicken and cook, stirring, for 5 minutes or until gravy bubbles and thickens slightly. Strain gravy into a jug."
