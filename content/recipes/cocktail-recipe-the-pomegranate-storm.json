    "text": "How to Make It a Pitcher DrinkWhether you&#x27;re just plain thirsty, or you&#x27;re hosting a party, this recipe easily converts from a drink for one into a pitcher drink that satisfies a crowd. I like to batch my drinks ahead of time, so I have less to worry about when my guests arrive. Just muddle, mix, strain, and chill in the fridge, until you&#x27;re ready to serve.Multiply the ingredients by the number of drinks you&#x27;d like to make and combine in a pitcher. You can combine the muddling ingredients and liquors ahead of time, but make sure to add the sparkling components just before you&#x27;re ready to pour. Garnish with mint.Be sure to use ginger beer in this recipe. Ginger ale is something completely different. Opt for the spiciest you can find. I used Reed&#x27;s Extra Ginger Brew.Strawberries not in season? No worries. Blackberries or raspberries work well with this cocktail.If you enjoy a thicker cocktail, feel free to bypass the straining step. Think muddled mojito.Forgo the dull, pre-packaged lemon juice. Always use freshly squeezed juice.Avoid the tendency to over-compensate with ginger beer. If you need more effervescence, just add more soda. Depending upon the level of sweetness, the ginger beer can come across as too cloying or thick on the palate, especially when combined with the pomegranate molasses."
