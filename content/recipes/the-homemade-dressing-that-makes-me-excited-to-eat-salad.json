    "description": "Salad dressing at my house used to come in one of two forms: a store-bought bottle or a homemade one that was honestly pretty lackluster. Designed to have a long shelf life, my homemade one didn’t have any fresh ingredients like garlic or shallots but relied on just vinegar, mustard, and oil instead. While it was perfectly fine, it didn’t make meals exciting to eat; rather, it was used out of sheer convenience for the occasional dinner side salad.\n\nSee the full recipe [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/christines-house-dressing-recipe-23078966)",
