  "headline": "Edd Kimber&#8217;s Salted Black Cocoa Sables",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Black cocoa: Black cocoa is a form of Dutch process cocoa. You can use regular Dutch process cocoa like Guittard Cocoa Rouge, but the cookies will have a slightly different flavour and the color won’t be as dramatic.Make ahead: The cookie logs can be frozen for up to 2 months in two ways:1) Freeze the log whole, then thaw in the refrigerator before slicing and baking.2) Chill the log until firm. Slice the dough, then form the slices back into a log. Wrap up again and freeze. You can then just bake off the desired number of slices straight from the freezer.Storage: Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature 4 to 5 days.Recipe orginally published on Edd Kimber&#x27;s blog, The Boy Who Bakes."

Every 10 to 15 minutes, give the chocolate a thorough stir, scraping all the chocolate up from the bottom to prevent it from burning -- sometimes the chocolate will clump and seem grainy. Once the chocolate has turned to a dulce de leche-like caramel colour, give it a very vigorous stir until smooth and glossy. Scrape it into a wide, shallow plastic container, preferably something larger than 6 inches wide. Refrigerate uncovered until solid."
