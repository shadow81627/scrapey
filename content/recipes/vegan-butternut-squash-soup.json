If you don’t have an immersion blender, you can do this in a food processor. If you are using a food processor, allow your soup to cool slightly before transferring it carefully to the food processor. Be sure not to over-fill your food processor. This is best done in batches. Serve immediately with additional cashew cream, toasted pepitas, or freshly ground pepper."
