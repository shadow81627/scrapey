  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: The curry can be made up to 1 day ahead without the basil, cooled, and refrigerated in an airtight container. Reheat over medium heat and stir in the basil before serving.Vegetarian: To make vegetarian panang, substitute firm tofu for the chicken and use soy sauce or salt to taste instead of the fish sauce. Use a curry paste without shrimp paste, such as Maesri.Fresno chile substitute: A serrano or jalape√±o pepper can be used in place of the Fresno chile.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat gently on the stove. Coconut milk curries should not be frozen, as the texture will be affected."
