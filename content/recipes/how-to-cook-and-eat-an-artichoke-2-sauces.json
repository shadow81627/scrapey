      "text": "TO CUT ARTICHOKE: With the artichoke held on its side on a cutting board, use a large serrated knife to cut off the top third (~1 inch), creating a flat top revealing the inner petals. Then cut off the stem right to the base of the artichoke so it can sit flat on the cutting board."

      "text": "TO STEAM ARTICHOKE: Add ~2 inches of water to a large pot with a steamer basket insert over the water and bring to a boil over high heat. Meanwhile, cut a lemon in half and rub the outside of the artichoke petals and flat top with the lemon to prevent browning. Once the water is boiling, reduce heat to medium and place the artichoke(s) top side down in the steamer basket and cover with a lid. Steam for ~25-35 minutes (depending on the size of your artichokes), adding more water after 15 minutes to avoid scorching your pot."

      "text": "SAUCE: While the artichoke is cooking, prepare your choice of sauce for dipping (Lemon Dill Butter or Creamy Lemon Dill Dip). The Lemon Dill Butter is lighter and more lemony and the Creamy Lemon Dill Dip is more of a classic, mayo-based dip that’s lightened up with coconut yogurt. To prepare either dip, stir all ingredients together in a small bowl. Adjust by adding more lemon juice for tartness or salt to taste."

      "text": "HOW TO KNOW YOUR ARTICHOKE’S COOKED: Use tongs to carefully transfer the artichokes to a cutting board or serving plate. To check if they’re done, pull out a petal — it should pull straight out easily. If it doesn’t, return the artichoke to the steamer basket and cook for ~5 minutes more, or until the petals slide out easily."

      "text": "HOW TO EAT ARTICHOKE: When ready to eat, place the artichoke on a serving plate. Working from the outside, pull each leaf/petal out one at a time. The edible part is the slightly thicker bottom part of the petal where it was attached. Dip that into the sauce and use your teeth to scrape out the small soft bit at the bottom while holding the top of the petal. Discard the remaining petal (it’s difficult to chew). Repeat this process until you get petals with pink on them (they don’t have much edible flesh)."

      "text": "ARTICHOKE HEART: The pink petals are a sign you’re almost to the artichoke heart (the tender center). Peel off and discard all the petals until you get to a part that looks like a lot of hairy fibers. Use a spoon to go around the edge where the fibers join the soft flesh and scoop in a circular motion to remove and discard the hair-like fibers called the choke (they’re inedible). The remaining round portion is the heart, and it’s edible, buttery, and tender. Slice it up and dip it in the sauce or spoon the sauce on top."
