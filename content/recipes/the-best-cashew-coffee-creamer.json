      "text": "If you do own a high-powered blender, this step isn't necessary as the blender will be powerful to make a very smooth cream without soaking. If you do not own a high-powered blender, I recommend starting by softening the cashews for the creamiest coffee creamer.To soak the cashews: add the cashews to a bowl, and cover with water. Let soak for a minimum of 6 hours and up to 48 hours until very tender. Drain and rinse cashews before using."
