  "description": "This lite version of Annie&#039;s Goddess sesame dressing has about 1/7 the amount of calories as the original and 1/13th the fat. That&#039;s 19 calories and 1 gram of fat per serving! But you can make this dressing more like the original by increasing the tahini a tablespoon at a time, until it tastes the way you like. Remember that the fat and calories go up as the tahini increases!",
