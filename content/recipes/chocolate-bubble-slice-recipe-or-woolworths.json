Tip 1: These slices are best stored in the fridge or freezer for up to 2 weeks. Tip 2: You can swap the quinoa flakes with rolled oats and rice bubbles with organic puffed rice. Tip 3: It is essential to cut slice when it's completely set and chilled from the fridge. Use a very sharp knife and wipe away the crumbs on the blade with every cut."
