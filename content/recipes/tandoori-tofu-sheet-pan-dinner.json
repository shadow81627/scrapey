    "7 ounces extra-firm tofu, drained and pressed",
    "2 small (~1/2 lb each) sweet potatoes, cut into 1-inch wedges",
    "2 cups small cauliflower florets",
    "1/2 medium red onion, halved and thinly sliced (1 medium onion yields ~100 g or 1 cup sliced)",
    "2 Tbsp olive or avocado oil",
    "2 Tbsp Tandoori Spice Mix (or store-bought)",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "Easy Green Chutney"

Place the veggies on the parchment-lined baking sheet in two sections: 1) sweet potatoes and 2) red onion and cauliflower. Crumble the tofu into pieces less than 1/2-inch in size and arrange the tofu crumbles next to the veggies."
