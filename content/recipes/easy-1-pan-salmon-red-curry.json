Light, satisfying, and incredibly flavorful.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-1-pan-salmon-red-curry/\n\nRed curry is a popular Thai dish made with a base of red curry paste, coconut milk, and vegetables, meat, and/or seafood. The paste is typically made with red chilies, garlic, lemongrass, and other herbs and spices, making it spicy and fragrant! Our inspired salmon curry uses these same Thai flavors, but applies them to salmon and lacinato kale, which are not common ingredients in Thai cuisine.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
