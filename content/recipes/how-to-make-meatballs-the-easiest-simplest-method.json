    "text": "Doubling this recipe: This recipe can be doubled for larger crowds.Storing leftover meatballs: Store leftover meatballs, either on their own or in a sauce, in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat over low heat in a saucepan or in the microwave.Make-ahead meatballs: Meatballs can be shaped and kept refrigerated up to a day ahead. Arrange them in a casserole dish or on a baking sheet, but don&#x27;t squish together. Cover and refrigerate for up to 1 day.Freezing uncooked meatballs: Prepare the meatballs through Step 5. Arrange in a single layer on a baking sheet and freeze until solid. Transfer the meatballs to a freezer container or freezer bag, and freeze for up to 1 month. (Meatballs can be frozen for longer, but tend to develop freezer burn.) Thaw meatballs in the refrigerator overnight before cooking.Freezing cooked meatballs: Let the cooked meatballs cool completely, then arrange in a single layer on baking sheet and freeze until solid. Transfer to a freezer container or bag and freeze for up to 2 months. Frozen meatballs can be thawed overnight in the refrigerator or reheated directly from the freezer. Reheat meatballs in a simmering sauce for 10 to 15 minutes or in a warm oven for 10 to 15 minutes."

    "description": "When I get a craving for meatballs, I have a very specific meatball in mind: They're completely tender all the way through without even a hint of toughness. They're big enough to require a fork, but modest enough to justify several on the plate. Maybe some onions and fresh herbs mixed in. Nothing fancy. Totally old-school. Yes, this is a recipe for those very meatballs. More than a recipe — I'm walking you through each step, from mixing the meat (use your hands!) to shaping the meatballs to cooking them to perfection. I know what I'm having for dinner tonight. Do you?",
