      "text": "Add broth and butter to stuffing before reheating to 165째F. Before you begin any of the reheating methods, remove the leftover stuffing from the refrigerator and take a look at it. Often upon refrigeration, the stuffing will soak up any excess moisture and will appear drier than when originally served. Depending on the amount of stuffing you plan to reheat, drizzle a few tablespoons or up to 1/4 cup of chicken or turkey stock into the stuffing to moisten it. Adding a pat of butter to the top of the stuffing before reheating adds some richness that can be lost with leftovers. In all reheating methods, stuffing temperature should reach 165째F on an instant-read thermometer."
