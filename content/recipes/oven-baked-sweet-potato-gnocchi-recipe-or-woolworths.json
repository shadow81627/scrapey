PASTA: This recipe can be used for potato, pumpkin, potato and spinach, potato and silverbeet, potato and beetroot. I have experimented with these and they are delish, the only limitation on trying different flavours is your imagination. MAKE IT AHEAD: The pasta can be kept in a sealed contained in the fridge for a few days if you want to make it ahead of time. I add some semolina or flour, give it a shake to coat the pieces to prevent them sticking together (It also freezes well like this)"
