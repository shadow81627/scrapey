  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 package extra firm or super firm tofu, pressed well",
    "1 cup marinara sauce",
    "1/2 cup shredded vegan cheese",
    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "Optional toppings: vegan parmesan, fresh herbs such as parsley or basil",
    "1/3 cup all purpose flour",
    "1/3 cup plain, unsweetened plant based milk (I used almond)",
    "1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1 cup panko breadcrumbs",
    "1 1/2 tablespoons nutritional yeast",
    "1 teaspoon granulated garlic",
    "1 teaspoon dried oregano"

I put the tofu on its side and cut 4 big slices out of it. You can really cut the tofu whichever way works best for you. Set tofu aside while you make the batter and panko mixture."

      "text": "Batter and bread your tofu: I like to use my hands to spread the batter on all sides of the tofu. You don’t need it to be too thick, just a light coating to help the panko stick to the tofu. After spreading the batter on the tofu, place it in the panko mixture. Sprinkle the panko on top of the tofu and make sure the tofu is completely coated with panko. Repeat with each slice of tofu."

      "text": "Cook the tofu: You can either bake the tofu or pan fry it. I like to pan fry mine in about a tablespoon or so of oil so the crust gets really nice and crispy. Heat a large pan with oil and place the tofu in. Cook for about 5 minutes each side, until browned and crispy."
