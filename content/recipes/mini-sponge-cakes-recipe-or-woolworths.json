Increase speed to high and beat for 10 minutes, gradually adding sugar, until mixture is pale and has tripled in volume. To check mixture is ready, lift the beaters and as the mixture falls onto the surface, draw a figure 8. It should be visible and hold its shape before slowly disappearing."

      "text": "Using a plain 7.5cm cutter, cut out 12 rounds from the cake. Layer three rounds with cream and jam. Top with cream and raspberries. Repeat for remaining rounds. Dust with icing sugar just before serving. Tip 1: You can substitute any flavour jam for this recipe. Try these delicious Gold varieties: Cherry & Vanilla, Apricot & Amaretto, Summer Berries & Elderflower and Strawberry. There’s even Whisky Marmalade! They’re great for toast, serving with scones and as a tart filling. Tip 2: Looking to take your baking and desserts to the next level without the fuss? The indulgent Gold sauce range is a devilishly delicious cheating option that your guests will never guess at!"
