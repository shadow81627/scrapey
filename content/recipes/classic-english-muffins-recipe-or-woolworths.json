Cover with the lid and cook very gently for 10-12 minutes or until they puff up and the undersides are golden and toasted. Turn over and cook for 3-4 minutes or until golden underneath. Cool on a wire rack. Muffins are great split, toasted, and spread with butter and jam, or as the base for eggs Benedict."
