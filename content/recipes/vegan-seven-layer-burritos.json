Allow to simmer, covered, until all of the water has been absorbed, about 40 minutes. Remove from heat and allow to sit for 5 minutes with the lid on. Uncover and fluff a few times with a fork.

Cook 5 minutes, until soft and translucent. Add the garlic and cook 1 minute more, until very fragrant. Stir in the beans, cumin, and 1 cup of water. Raise heat and bring the liquid to a simmer. Lower heat and allow to simmer until the beans fall apart completely, about 40 minutes, adding water to the skillet every so often (about 1/2 cup at a time), as it dries out. When finished cooking, remove from heat and season with salt to taste."
