      "text": "Drop the soft(not stiff and not too sticky) dough onto a parchment-lined sheet. Press with your hands to make a 1/2-3/4 inch flat rectangle. use a bit of oil or rice flour if needed. Use a cookie cutter to make the biscuits or hands to roll up into free form bun style biscuits. I used 1.5 inch round cookie cutter. Place biscuits half an inch apart on a greased or parchment-lined sheet or pan. Spray water all over the biscuits. Then brush the tops with melted vegan butter or EVOO. Lightly cover the sheet with aluminum foil."

      "text": "Bake in pre-heated 425 degrees F for 18-20 minutes until the tops just start to get golden. Remove the foil from the top at the 17-minute mark, if you like the biscuits more golden and crisp, and bake without the foil for 2+ minutes. Remove biscuits from the oven and let cool for 2-3 minutes. Slice open and serve with vegan butter, gravy, soups. If you bake them for the entire time without the foil, the biscuits might appear hard on the outside, but they will be moist and soft on the inside."
