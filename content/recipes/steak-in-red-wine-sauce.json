    "1 thick-cut (about 1 1/2-inch-thick) New York strip or ribeye steak (about 18 ounces)",
    "1 large shallot",
    "1 clove garlic",
    "1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt, divided",
    "4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, divided",
    "2 (5-inch) sprigs fresh rosemary or thyme",
    "1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar",

    "1/2 cup dry red wine, such as Malbec or Cabernet Sauvignon",

Carefully place the steak in the hot pan and cook until enough of a crust has developed on the bottom that the steak no longer sticks to the pan, about 2 minutes. Flip and cook on the other side for 1 minute. Continue cooking and flipping every minute until the steak reaches your preferred doneness, between 125 and 130oF for medium rare. Begin checking the internal temperature of the steak after 8 to 10 minutes total cook time."

Cook until the shallots are browned, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add 3/4 cup beef broth and 1/2 cup dry red wine and cook until reduced to about 1/2 cup, 7 to 9 minutes."
