    "description": "This three-ingredient lunch is so quick and satisfying that you just might find yourself making it again for dinner. Give a few big handfuls of zucchini noodles a quick sauté, dress them with a purchased garlicky basil pesto, top the whole mess with a crispy on the outside, runny on the inside fried egg, and dig in. It's a wholesome, veggie-packed meal that's got enough protein from the egg to keep you going until your next meal. Oh, and it takes no more than six minutes to make.",
