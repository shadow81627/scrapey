    "2.5 lb (1.13 kg) potatoes (, I like to use Yukon Gold)",
    "4 cloves garlic",
    "2 teaspoons salt (, plus more to taste)",
    "enough water to cover",
    "1 cup (240 mls) soy milk (, it must be unsweetneed and unflavoured)",
    "6 tablespoons vegan butter (, plus a bit more for the serving)",
    "6 leaves fresh sage",
    "2 sprigs fresh thyme",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (, plus more to taste )"

      "text": "Place a lid on the pan and bring to a boil then simmer until the potatoes are really tender and a knife inserts into them easily. It will take 25 to 30 minutes depending on how big the potato chunks are."

      "text": "Meanwhile, while the potatoes are cooking, add the milk, butter, sage, thyme and pepper to a small pan and place over medium heat until hot and the butter is melted. Turn off and set aside to allow the flavours to infuse while the potatoes finish cooking."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
