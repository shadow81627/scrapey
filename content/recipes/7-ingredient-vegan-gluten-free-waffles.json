    "1 1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk",
    "1 tsp white or apple cider vinegar",
    "1/4 cup olive, avocado, or melted coconut oil",
    "1/4 cup agave nectar or maple syrup (or honey if not vegan)",
    "1/2 heaping cup gluten-free rolled oats",
    "1 3/4 cups gluten-free flour blend",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking powder",
    "1 pinch sea salt",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1/2 tsp cinnamon",
    "1 Tbsp flaxseed meal",
    "1/4 cup dairy-free chocolate chips",

      "text": "Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk until well combined. Then add wet ingredients to dry and mix until well incorporated. The mixture will be slightly thick and scoopable (not too gloppy, not pourable). If too thick, thin with a bit of almond milk. If too thin, add a bit more flour."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Let set for 5-10 minutes while your waffle iron preheats. NOTE: We also tested these in a nonstick Belgian waffle iron and found that while the waffles did not have any issues with sticking, they didn't always fully cook on the inside. If using a Belgian-style waffle maker, we recommend cooking waffles on the medium heat setting but for a longer time (two rounds) and letting them rest for 5-10 minutes after cooking for best texture."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once waffle iron is ready, generously coat with non-stick spray or oil and pour on about 1/2 cup of batter. Cook according to manufacturer instructions, but cook on the longer range of your waffle iron's suggestion. We find gluten-free waffles tend to take a little longer to cook than gluten waffle. And if you open the waffle iron too early they're more prone to sticking."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once waffle is cooked, carefully remove from waffle maker and place on a baking rack in a 200 degree F (90 C) oven to keep warm. Do not stack; instead, keep them in a single layer to ensure they remain crispy."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Serve immediately with desired toppings, such as fresh cherry-berry compote and more maple syrup. Store leftovers in a freezer safe bag and reheat in the toaster for best results (see notes for more instructions). Will keep in the freezer for up to a couple of months, although they're freshest within the first couple of weeks."
