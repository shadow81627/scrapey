      "text": "Make the pickled onions at least a half hour before putting the salad together. Slice 1/2 of a large red onion. Place it in a strainer, hold the strainer over the sink, and pour a quart of boiling water over it. Set aside to drain. While it is draining, pour the vinegar into a glass storage jar or bowl, add the sugar, salt, peppercorns, and garlic to the vinegar and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add the drained onions to the jar, stir gently, and set aside to cool. Pickled Red Onions will keep for several weeks."
