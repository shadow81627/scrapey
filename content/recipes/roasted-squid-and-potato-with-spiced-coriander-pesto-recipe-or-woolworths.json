Add most of the Parmesan and chilli flakes, and whiz again. Now slowly add the olive oil in a gradual stream, and pulse until the pesto forms a smooth paste and reaches the right consistency. Stir through the remaining Parmesan, taste, and season with salt and black pepper if it needs it. Set aside."
