    "Avocado oil (or other neutral oil // for greasing pan)",
    "2 cups warm water",
    "2 Tbsp organic cane sugar",
    "1 packet active dry yeast (we used Red Star // 1 packet yields ~2 1/4 tsp or 7 g)",
    "1/4 cup ground chia seeds",
    "1 cup brown rice flour (plus more for flouring pan)",
    "3/4 cup oat flour (certified gluten-free as needed // if oat-free, you can try subbing additional sorghum flour)",
    "1 cup potato starch",
    "3/4 cup sorghum flour",
    "2 tsp sea salt"

Whisk in the packet of yeast and let it bloom on the counter for 10 minutes until frothy. If it doesn’t foam, start over — your water may have been too hot or the packet of yeast was expired."

Remove the bread from the oven and let it cool in the pan for 10 minutes. Then transfer to a cooling rack to cool completely before cutting into it."
