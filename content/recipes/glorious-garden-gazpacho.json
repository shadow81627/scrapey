  "description": "Giving this soup a good chill in the fridge before serving is key to developing the flavours. An hour is good, overnight is fine too. You may first taste it and think it not garlicky enough. I recommend you wait a bit and taste again as the garlic flavour needs a bit of time to bloom.",
