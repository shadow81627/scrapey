Once it’s hot, put one romaine half on it, two if they will fit. Close the top of the Foreman grill or press the lettuce down lightly with a spatula if you are using a grill pan. Cook for about 2 or 3 minutes, until lettuce has begun to wilt and grill marks to appear; then, if you’re using a grill pan, turn over and grill for another 2 minutes."
