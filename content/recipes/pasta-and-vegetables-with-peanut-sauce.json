    "8 ounces pasta (cooked)",
    "1/2 bunch broccoli (cut into florets and stems peeled and sliced)",
    "14 baby carrots (halved lengthwise)",
    "2 zucchini (halved lengthwise and sliced into 1/2-inch pieces)",
    "2 teaspoons dark sesame oil (optional or to taste)",
    "2-3 cloves garlic (chopped)",
    "1 teaspoon ginger root (minced)",
    "2 tablespoons natural peanut butter (I used chunky because that’s what we had)",
    "1/2-3/4 cup hot water",
    "1/4 cup soy sauce (replace with more water if you’re salt-free)",

After a few minutes, or when the broccoli begins to turn bright green, add the zucchini and steam until all vegetables are tender but still crisp. The time will vary depending on the method of steaming you use, so just watch them carefully and don’t let them over-cook."

Add the peanut butter, and cook, stirring, until it is heated through. Slowly stir in the hot water and add soy sauce, vinegar, and cayenne. Stir until it is a smooth mixture, adding more water if it is too thick. Then add the cooked pasta and toss to coat."
