    "text": "White pepper: You can substitute white pepper for the cayenne pepper.Make ahead: Hollandaise sauce can be made up to 1 day in advance. Press a sheet of plastic wrap directly onto the surface to prevent a skin from forming, then refrigerate.To reheat in the microwave, heat at 20 percent power in 15-second increments, stirring after each increment, until the sauce is warm and smooth, but not hot. You donâ€™t want to overcook the eggs. Alternatively, reheat in a double boiler or bowl the same way you made it initially until warm but not hot."
