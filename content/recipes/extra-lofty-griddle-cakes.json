Cook until the edges start to firm up and the bottoms are golden brown (you may not get the tiny bubbles you get on regular pancakes since this batter is thick and fluffy), 3 to 4 minutes. Use a flat spatula to carefully flip the pancakes. Cook until the second side is golden brown (the centers will not yet be cooked through), about 1 minute more."
