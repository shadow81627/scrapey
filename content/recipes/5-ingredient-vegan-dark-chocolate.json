    "1 1/4 cup finely chopped cacao butter*",
    "2 Tbsp coconut oil",

I added about 2 Tbsp maple syrup total (as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), but itâ€™s completely up to you and how sweet you prefer your chocolate. Add more vanilla to enhance the chocolate flavor and add depth of flavor, salt for saltiness, or more cacao/cocoa powder for intense chocolate flavor."

      "text": "Pour your chocolate into molds of choice. I like these bar molds, but you can also just pour into paper cupcake liners, or an 8x8-inch baking dish lined with parchment paper. At this point, sprinkle on your cacao nibs. I also sprinkle on a pinch more salt."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Carefully transfer to freezer (I like setting mine on a baking sheet or plate so it lies flat and is stable while chilling). Remove from molds once the chocolate is set - about 1 hour."

      "text": "Store covered in the refrigerator for several weeks or in the freezer for even longer. Let come to almost room temperature before enjoying, as it's creamier and the flavors are more pronounced when it's warmed up a bit."
