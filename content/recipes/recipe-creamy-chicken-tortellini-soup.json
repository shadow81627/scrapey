Meanwhile, add the tortellini to the soup and cook for 7 minutes, stirring occasionally. Once cool enough to handle, shred the chicken with 2 forks or cut it into bite-sized pieces, then add it back into the soup. Stir in the half-and-half, spinach, parsley, oregano, nutmeg, and black pepper. Cook until the spinach wilts, 1 to 2 minutes. Ladle into bowls and serve with grated Parmesan cheese."
