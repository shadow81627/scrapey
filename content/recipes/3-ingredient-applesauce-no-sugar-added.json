    "2 medium honeycrisp apples, peeled, cored, and chopped in bite-size pieces",
    "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon (plus more to taste)",

      "text": "Use the back of a wooden spoon or potato masher to mash into a loose sauce. You could also blend with an immersion blender, in a food processor or high-speed blender for smoother texture (optional) – a helpful step if you left the skins on. Add a dash of maple syrup or sugar of choice to sweeten (optional – depends on sweetness of your apples)."
