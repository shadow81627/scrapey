Pat the dough down and use cookie cutters to cut desired shapes. I used 1 inch round cutter. Gather remaining dough, pat down and cut more cookies or shape into balls and flatten. Place the cookies on parchment lined baking sheet, cover with another parchment and refrigerate for 15 minutes(or 10 minutes in the freezer). Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F / 190oc. Bake for 13-14 minutes(a few minutes longer for larger cookies) until the edges just about start to get golden. Move the cookies around from outside to inside at the 11 minute mark. Let cool completely. Serve as is or dip in melted chocolate or top with favorite frosting."
