  "description": "The Best Vegan Ceviche is made with hearts of palm which have a tender, flaky texture, and mild taste making it a fantastic fish substitute. Nori seaweed is added to the mix for a slight taste of the sea. Combined with avocado, cherry tomatoes, and lots of lime juice. Just 10 ingredients and 15 minutes to make, this is the perfect easy-to-make summer appetizer!",
