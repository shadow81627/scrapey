  "recipeIngredient": [
    "3/4 cup thinly sliced white or yellow onion* (1/2 small onion yields ~3/4 cup or 80 g)",
    "1 Tbsp brown rice flour* (or all-purpose flour if not GF // see notes for other flours)",
    "1/4 tsp garlic powder",
    "1/4 tsp each sea salt and black pepper",
    "1 Tbsp avocado or olive oil (plus more as needed)"

      "text": "To ensure evenly cooked and crispy onions, you want the onion slices to be very thin (about 1/16-inch) and as even in size as possible. We recommend cutting the onion in half (or quarters if it’s large), then slicing with the cut side on the cutting board. Or, you could use a mandolin."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Meanwhile, heat 1/2 Tbsp oil in a large skillet (preferably cast iron) over medium heat. Test the oil by sprinkling in some flour. It should make a sound but not burn."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "When the oil is hot, add about half of the onions in a single layer (overcrowding the pan will result in soggy onions // if using a smaller pan or making a larger batch, adjust accordingly)."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Fry until golden on both sides, about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, and reducing the heat as needed to avoid burning. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate in a single layer and repeat with the remaining 1/2 Tbsp oil and the onions."
