      "text": "While the noodles are boiling, make the Bechamel Sauce. To make the sauce, heat vegan butter in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Once butter is melted, add flour and stir over heat for 3-4 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and golden-brown. In another pot, bring milk, minced garlic, herbs, nutmeg, and salt to a boil. Add hot milk to butter/flour mixture in 3 batches. Bring to a boil, whisking often, then reduce heat to a simmer. Cook for 10 minutes, whisking constantly. Once thick and creamy, remove from heat and set aside. The sauce will continue to thicken as it cools."

Add a layer of the mushroom/spinach mixture and top with 1/2 of the cashew ricotta, evenly dropping them in 1 tablespoon-size pieces. Top this with more bechamel and marinara sauce and repeat the pattern one full time. Top with the 3rd layer of noodles and final layer of sauces. Top with vegan parmesan, if using."
