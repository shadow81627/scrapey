Scatter over the tomato and the cheese, then top with the other tortilla, pressing it down with the back of a fish slice to sandwich the two together. Scoop the quesadilla up, carefully turn it over, and cook the other side for another minute, or until golden. Slice in half or quarters, and serve."
