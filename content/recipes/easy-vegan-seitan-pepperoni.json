Can be stored in the fridge or freezer so you have it on hand whenever you need vegan pepperoni.&nbsp;Recipe adapted from my Vegan Seitan Steaks, but shout out goes to The Easy Vegan's version for the funniest video.&nbsp;",

      "text": "Divide the dough into two pieces then roll the dough pieces into two logs about 6 inches long each. Roll each log up loosely in a piece of aluminum foil then twist the ends closed. Steam for 30 minutes. Oil may release during steaming and appear in the steamer basket and water, and that's ok. After 30 minutes, remove the logs from the steamer and allow to cool completely in the fridge. The logs will have puffed up in the foil and become tight. Once cooled, remove the foil and they are ready to slice and enjoy as you like."
