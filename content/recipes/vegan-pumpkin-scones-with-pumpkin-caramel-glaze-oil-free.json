The mixture will initially feel very dry and then start to come become fat crumbs and dough like. Add another tbsp of coconut cream if needed. Once there isnt much dry flour left, bring it together with a spatula or your hands quickly and shape into a fat disc, atleast 3/4 inch tall. Slice into 6 to 8 triangles using a pizza cutter."

Add a few drops of vanilla extract for a vanilla pumpkin spice glaze. Let it cool for a few minutes before drizzling on the warm scones. Sprinkle chopped pecans on top (optional). Serve warm as is or with some vegan butter. You can also use a simple sugar icing or a maple sugar glaze."
