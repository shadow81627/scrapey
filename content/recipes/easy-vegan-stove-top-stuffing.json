    "2 tablespoons vegan butter",
    "2 carrots, (peeled and chopped)",
    "2 ribs celery, (chopped)",
    "1 yellow onion, (chopped)",
    "4 cloves garlic, (minced)",
    "1/2 teaspoon dried thyme leaves",
    "1/2 teaspoon dried rosemary leaves",
    "1/2 teaspoon powdered sage",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Stir in the thyme, rosemary, sage, salt, and pepper. Then add the toasted bread cubes, vegetable broth, and dried cranberries -no need stir at this point. Remove the pan from heat and cover, then let sit for 10 - 15 minutes until softened. Once softened it will be easy to stir, so stir well to combine and serve hot. *I find some types of bread are more absorbent than others so if 1 cup of vegetable broth was not enough to reach desired texture, add a splash more, cover and let sit again until desired texture is reached."
