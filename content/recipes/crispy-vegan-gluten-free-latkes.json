    "1/4 cup potato starch*",

    "1/2 tsp sea salt (plus more for topping)",
    "1/4 cup avocado oil (DIVIDED // or other neutral, high heat oil)",

Form latkes using ~1/4 cup of the mixture and pressing it between your palms into a flat patty with jagged edges (this creates a delicious crispy outer rim — yum!). Once the oil is hot (test it by adding a small piece of the potato mixture — it should sizzle), add as many latkes as will fit comfortably in the pan and cook for 2-3 minutes per side, until deeply golden brown and crispy. Reduce the heat slightly if browning too quickly."
