Set the pan over high heat and bring the water to a boil. Lower heat so the water is at a simmer, cover, and allow the tempeh to steam for 10 minutes. Alternatively, if you don't have a steamer basket, you can place the tempeh pieces right into the water. After 10 minutes, remove the saucepan from the heat, transfer the tempeh pieces to a plate, and allow them to cool a bit while you gather your other ingredients."
