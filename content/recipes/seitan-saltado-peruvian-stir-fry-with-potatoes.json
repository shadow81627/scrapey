      "text": "Preheat oven to 400F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Cut the potatoes into French fries, whatever size you like. (I used my mandolin to make skinny fries about 1/4-inch thick.) Sprinkle the fries with salt and pepper and spread in a single layer on the baking sheet. Bake, turning every 10-15 minutes, until fries are browning and becoming crispy, about 40 minutes depending on the size of your fries. Keep warm."

      "text": "When the fries are almost done, heat a large non-stick wok or skillet. Sauté the red onion until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the bell and jalapeño peppers and cook another two minutes. Add the seitan and chopped tomato and cook, stirring, until hot throughout. Stir in the vinegar and soy sauce and gently fold in the French fries and parsley. Serve alone or over rice with hot sauce on the side."
