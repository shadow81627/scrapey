At this point you can add another 2 tsp vegan butter (This helps with the texture)and mix in. Once the mixture starts to stick and is dry-ish, press cancel and let it sit. The pot will be hot for a while, let the carrot mixture slow cook in the heat for 15 mins or so. Stir once in between. When the mixture is warm-cool, serve, or store refrigerated. Garnish with chopped cashews or pistachios to serve chilled or warmed. Stove top version here."

    "description": "Instant Pot Gajar Halwa – Vegan Carrot Halwa /Pudding Recipe. \nFULL RECIPE HERE : https://www.veganricha.com/2018/02/instant-pot-gajar-halwa-carrot-halwa-recipe.html\n\n\nVOICE OVER VERSION: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1tS41eqrpw\n\nCarrot Halwa is an Indian dessert, a flourless Carrot Cake Crumble/pudding that is spiced with cardamom and served during festivals. It is a popular Winter-Spring dessert in Northern India.  My Dad’s fave version has grated carrots that get slow roasted in a skillet over hours to become almost candied and the mix is more like a soft crumble. This Instant pot version cooks within minutes and works amazingly. For a Stove top version see here https://www.veganricha.com/2016/09/vegan-carrot-halwa-gajar-halwa-recipe.html\n\nThe Carrots get roasted with sugar for a bit then pressure cooked, then roasted again to dry them up. This Instant Pot Halwa will cook to a softer more pudding like state, and gets close to the stove roasted one after sitting for a bit to cool. I use purple and red carrots for the gorgeous color that would normally show up only on long roasting. To make this nut-free, use sunflower seed meal and omit the cashews. \nVegan Gluten-free Soy-free Recipe.\n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFIND ME:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: By Clueless kit - Not you\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sl6VJ9ZKn9k",
