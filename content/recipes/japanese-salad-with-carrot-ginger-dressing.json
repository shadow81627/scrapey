    "1 teaspoon agave or sweetener of choice, (optional—you might not need it if your carrots are sweet)",
    "8 cups salad greens, (I used a baby lettuce mix)",

Stop to scrape the bowl down, and then continue running the food processor, drizzling in a few tablespoons of water if necessary. This is a thick dressing with some texture to it, so it won’t get completely smooth."
