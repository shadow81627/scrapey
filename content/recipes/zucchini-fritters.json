    "1/2 tsp dried oregano ($0.05)",
    "1/2 tsp dried basil ($0.05)",

Taste the zucchini and adjust the salt and pepper to your liking. It should be stronger than you want the finished product to be because once you add the flour and egg, the flavor and saltiness will be diluted."

      "text": "Heat 1/2 cup oil in a small skillet until very hot. To test the temperature, drop a SMALL piece of the batter into the oil, it should bubble heavily. The oil should not be smoking, if it is, lower the heat immediately. Drop the batter into the oil, one spoonful at a time. Fry the fritters on each side until deep golden brown. Let the fritters drain on a paper towel covered plate."
