    "2 and 1/4 cups uncooked white jasmine rice",
    "1 and 1/4 cup full-fat coconut milk",
    "water (see instructions)",
    "pinch salt",
    "(optional) 1 teaspoon grated ginger",
    "(optional) 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes",
    "1 and 1/2 cups uncooked green lentils",
    "2 tsp olive oil",
    "1/2 large red onion (thinly sliced)",
    "1 tsp cumin seeds",
    "3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "1 jalapeno (seeded and finely chopped)",
    "1 inch ginger (peeled and grated or minced)",
    "4 tsp garam masala",
    "1/2 tsp salt plus more to taste",
    "1/2 lime (juiced)",
    "1 cup diced tomatoes (I used canned)",

      "text": "Rinse the rice well. Add it to your rice cooker along with the rest of the rice ingredients, and enough water to reach level 3 in the rice cooker. Cook until done. If not using a rice cooker, or using a rice cooker without level markings, cook the rice with your usual method and amount of liquid, substituting the coconut milk for 1 and 1/4 cups of the water. Most rice packages will also include instructions. Do NOT make this with only the rice and coconut milk - you need to add water."
