    "1/2 medium lemon",
    "8 tablespoons (1 stick) unsalted butter, very soft",
    "About 1 cup loosely packed minced mixed fresh herbs (save the stems)",
    "4 medium scallions, white and light green parts only (save the dark green parts), minced",
    "Fine sea salt and freshly ground pepper",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 or 2 slices stale bread",
    "1 whole chicken (about 4 pounds), at room temperature or close to it",
    "1 small onion, sliced",
    "1 bay leaf",
    "2/3 cup white wine or water",
    "1 to 2 teaspoons sherry vinegar, for the pan sauce (optional)"

      "text": "Buttering the chicken can be a little tricky, messy too, but there’s also something very satisfying about it. Use your fingers to pull the chicken skin away from the meat, loosening it along the breasts and drumsticks. Work from the top and bottom of the chicken, lifting the skin up with your knuckles to help you open up some space without tearing the skin. Using a chunky pat at time, squish, squiggle and otherwise schmush most of the remaining butter under the skin of the chicken, spread-ing it as best as you can against the meat. Don’t worry about getting an even layer — the butter will melt and baste all the meat in the oven. Pat the skin dry and smear whatever butter remains over it. Season the chicken inside and out with salt and pepper and stuff the cavity with the reserved herb stems and scallion greens. Squeeze the half lemon over the bird and tuck the lemon into the cavity."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Sit the chicken breast side up on the bread. Toss the onion and bay leaf into the pot, pour the wine or water around the chicken and slide the pot into the oven. Roast the chicken, uncovered, for 50 to 60 minutes; if it looks as if the pan juices are running low, add some water. The chicken is done when a thermometer poked into the thickest part of a thigh registers 165°F. Alternatively, you can cut a slit in the chicken between the drumstick and breast and check that the juices run clear."
