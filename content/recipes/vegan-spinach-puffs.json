Place each square into the bottom of a muffin cavity, stretching it out just a bit by hand if needed so the corners reach a bit beyond the top of the cavity. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the spinach mixture into each puff pastry square. Fold the corners of each square inward and pinch then together at the center.
