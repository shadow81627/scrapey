    "4 Persian or mini seedless cucumbers, or 1 small English hothouse cucumber (about 12 ounces total)",
    "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lime juice",
    "Kosher salt",
    "2 tablespoons coconut or vegetable oil",
    "1/4 cup roasted, unsalted peanuts, coarsely chopped",
    "1/4 cup dried, unsweetened coconut flakes",

Add the coconut, turmeric, and a generous few grinds of black pepper. Cook, stirring, until the coconut is lightly toasted, just 30 seconds. Immediately pour the peanut-coconut mixture on top of the cucumbers. Season generously with salt and pepper and serve right away."
