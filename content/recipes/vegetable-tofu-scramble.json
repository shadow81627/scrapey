    "14 oz. firm or extra firm tofu ($1.99)",

    "2 Tbsp cooking oil ($0.08)",
    "1/2 tsp garlic powder ($0.05)",
    "1/4 tsp freshly cracked black pepper ($0.02)",

      "text": "If you have the opportunity, fully freeze and then thaw the tofu in the days before making the recipe. While this isn't required, it does produce a better texture. When you're ready to make the recipe, remove the tofu from the package and press or squeeze the excess moisture out of the tofu. You can use a tofu press, or place the tofu on a plate, top it with a cutting board, then place something heavy, like a pot, and wait about 15 minutes while the moisture is pressed out. When tofu has been frozen, it's a bit more spongey, and I can squeeze or press most of it out just using my hands."

Crumble the tofu into the skillet, then sprinkle the garlic powder and pepper over top. Sauté the tofu for 2-3 minutes in the hot skillet. Don't worry if it starts to stick, the moisture from the vegetables will loosen it from the bottom of the skillet."
