Add water and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook for 18 minutes or until water is absorbed and the quinoa is fluffy. Transfer cooked quinoa to a glass bowl or storage container and refrigerate (uncovered) to cool. Once completely cooled, cover. Will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week or in the freezer up to 1 month."

Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more chili garlic sauce for heat, lime for acidity, maple syrup for sweetness, almond butter for nuttiness, or coconut aminos for saltiness and depth of flavor. Set aside."

    "description": "Delicious, hearty quinoa \"fried rice\" stir-fry with broccoli, carrot, and a sweet-and-spicy sauce! Ready in less than 30 minutes, big flavor, and incredibly satisfying!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/30-minute-quinoa-fried-rice/\n\nThe exact origin of fried rice is unknown, but it’s earliest mention is believed to be in a book about Chinese cuisine from the Sui Dynasty (569-618). The story is that Emperor Yang Guang tasted the dish in Yangzhou and loved it so much that it became an imperial dish.\n\nOur plant-based version strays from traditional in terms of ingredients, but is similarly colorful and cooks the quinoa twice for a “fried” effect.\n\nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook:",
