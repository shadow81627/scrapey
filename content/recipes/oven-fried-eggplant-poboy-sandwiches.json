    "1 large eggplant (approximately 1 1/4pounds)",
    "3/4 cup non-dairy milk of choice",
    "1/2 cup cornmeal",
    "1/4 cup brown rice flour",
    "1 tablespoon lemon juice",
    "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "1 teaspoon salt (if desired)",

Holding the slice between two fingers, allow any excess batter to drip back into the bowl, and place the eggplant on the baking sheet. Repeat with as many slices as you can fit on the baking sheet, being careful that they do not touch. (If your baking sheet is small, you may need to make two batches; batter can thicken between batches, so add more liquid if necessary.)"
