It can also be refrigerated for up to 2 days. Reheat in a 350°F oven until warmed through, about 15 minutes."

To check if the cherries are ready, push one against the side of the skillet with a spatula. If it crushes easily, it’s well-cooked. If using fresh cherries, stir frequently in the beginning, as there will be little moisture and the mixture may burn if left unattended."
