      "text": "Depending on how much mixture you can get into the pasty, depends on how many you can make. I used a pack of 6 puff pastry sheets plus 2 extra that I had in the freezer. I cut 1 circle from each sheet and then re-roll the leftovers to best I can to get a few more out. I try not to use this as the pastry becomes a little bit tough and it's hard to get it thin enough. Today, I got 11 pasties and had mixture left over. If I had more puff pastry, I would have got another 4 pasties. It's trial and error."
