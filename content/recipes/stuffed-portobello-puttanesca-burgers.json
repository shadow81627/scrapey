Add garlic and sauté 1 minute more. Add beans to skillet, flip a few times to incorporate, and allow to cook until heated throughout, about 2 minutes. Use a fork or potato masher to lightly mash about half of the beans. Stir in parsley, basil, breadcrumbs and red wine vinegar. Season with salt and pepper to taste."
