    "185g tuna, drained",
    "5 tbs mayonnaise (save 1 tbsp for later)",

      "text": "Lay a slice of bread out, widthways. Spread a little extra mayonnaise in a 1cm line at one long edge of the piece of bread farthest from you (to help the sandwich stick together). Spread a thin layer of tuna over the bread, stopping where the line of mayonnaise starts. Lay a line of red capsicum at the long edge of the bread nearest to you, and top it with a thin line of cucumber."

      "text": "Pick up the edge nearest you, fold it over the vegetables, then roll until it sticks itself together with the mayonnaise. Trim the edges and cut into 4 pieces, using a sawing action so the shape does not get spoiled. Serve upright."
