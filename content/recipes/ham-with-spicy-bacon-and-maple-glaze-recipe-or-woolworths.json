Pour in vinegar and simmer for 30 minutes or until mixture has reduced by half and becomes sticky. Cool to room temperature before using. Tips. Baked Ham. When removing the rind from the ham, take care to leave the layer of fat under the rind intact. Run your fingers under the rind to separate it gently from the fat. Wrapping the ham in bacon before glazing adds another dimension of delicious flavour. The bacon will shrink a little as it cooks, so allow for a generous overlap. Glaze Note. This glaze can be made the day before. Use 120ml of glaze for every 1.3kg of ham."
