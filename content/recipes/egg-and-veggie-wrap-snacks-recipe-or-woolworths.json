Heat a large non-stick frying pan over medium heat and spray lightly with oil. Spray inside of a heatproof heart-shaped cutter with oil and place in pan. Place a tablespoon of mixture in cutter. Cook for 1 minute or until bubbles appear on the surface, then turn and cook for a further 1 minute or until golden and cooked through. Use a thin knife to release heart from the cutter. Set aside to cool. Repeat with remaining mixture to make 16 pikelets (serves 8). Place 2 pikelets in lunch box. Store remaining pikelets in an airtight container in the fridge."
