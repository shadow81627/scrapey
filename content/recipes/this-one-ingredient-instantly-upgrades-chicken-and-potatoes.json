    "4 whole chicken legs (2 1/2 to 3 pounds total)",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed",
    "3/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, divided",
    "5 large cloves garlic",
    "2 medium red or yellow onions",
    "1 pound small creamer potatoes, preferably about 1-inch wide",
    "1/3 cup pomegranate molasses",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more as needed",
    "5 sprigs fresh oregano, thyme, or marjoram, plus more for serving",
    "1 teaspoon mild chile flakes, such as Aleppo pepper (or 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes) (optional)",
    "Flaky salt, for serving"

Place 4 whole chicken legs in a cold 12-inch or larger cast-iron skillet and season all over with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper. Arrange skin-side down in a single layer—it’s OK if they’re snug, but they shouldn’t overlap."
