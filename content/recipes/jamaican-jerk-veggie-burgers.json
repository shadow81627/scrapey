Gently simmer the quinoa until all the liquid is absorbed, 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and let the quinoa sit, covered, for another 5 minutes. Fluff with a fork and set aside."

Add the beans, habañero or Scotch bonnet pepper, oats, lime juice, molasses, soy sauce, ginger, allspice, cinnamon, thyme, black pepper and nutmeg. Blend for a few seconds, just until everything is well-mixed, stopping to scrape down the sides of bowl as needed. Fold in the quinoa and season with salt if needed."

Use a spatula to gently press down on the tops of patties and pull the sides in, shaping them as they cook. Cook until the mixture has firmed a bit and the patties are browned on the bottoms, about 5 minutes. Gently flip and cook until browned on the opposite sides, about 5 minutes more. Add a bit more oil between batches if skillet becomes dry."
