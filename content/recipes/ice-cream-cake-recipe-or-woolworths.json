      "text": "When ready to serve, remove ice cream cake from freezer and wipe outside of pan with a hot wet cloth. Remove cake from tin and plastic. Transfer to a chilled cake stand. Press cones firmly but gently around the side, pushing into the ice-cream. Position wafers into spaces between cones. Fill cones and cover top with pre-scooped ice cream. Return cake to the freezer to firm up again. Serve immediately. Tip 1: Ice-cream scoops - Prepare ice-cream scoops in advance and keep them in the freezer on a baking paper lined tray until needed. When you are ready to assemble the cake, you can simply lift them into position. Tip 2: Try this easy way to stand up the cones while they dry: fill a bowl with sugar. Dip the cones and push pointed ends into sugar so the cones stay upright. You can do the same with the wafertriangles. Note: Any desired ice cream can be used."
