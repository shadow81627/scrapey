    "3 Tbsp olive oil or vegan butter",
    "4 large cloves garlic, chopped (yields ~3 Tbsp as original recipe is written)",
    "1/3 cup dry white wine (Pinot Grigio, Chardonnay, + Sauvignon Blanc, are best)",
    "4 Tbsp arrowroot starch (or cornstarch)",
    "1 3/4 cup unsweetened plain almond milk",
    "4 Tbsp nutritional yeast",

The sauce should thicken, at which point you can lower the heat to low and simmer until pasta is cooked. If it looks too thick, thin with almond milk.
