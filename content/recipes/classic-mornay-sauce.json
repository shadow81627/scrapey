  "description": "Mornay sauce seems intimidating, but it’s a shockingly easy and relatively quick cheese sauce to make, and great to have in your cooking repertoire for many dishes.",
  "headline": "Classic Mornay Sauce",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Parmesan cheese substitute: 4 ounces Gruyére, raclette, or Swiss cheese can be used in place of the Parmesan. And although not traditional, you could also substitute it with white cheddar cheese.Make ahead: Although the sauce is better served immediately, it can be made up to 4 days ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container. Reheat on the stovetop over low heat and whisk until smooth. The sauce will have thickened significantly, so you may need to loosen it with a splash of milk when reheating and adjust the seasoning as needed."
