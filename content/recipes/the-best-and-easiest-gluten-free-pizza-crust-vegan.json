    "2 cups + 3 tablespoons gluten free all purpose flour, I used Bob Red Mill’s 1:1 GF Baking Flour***",

    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "1 teaspoon pure maple syrup",

Using your hands, form the dough into a ball. Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Set dough aside for 30 minutes."

      "text": "While dough is rising, preheat the oven to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. Cover a pizza pan (whatever size you like*) with parchment paper and place the ball of pizza dough on the paper. Use your hands to spread the dough out until it is in an even layer. Dough works best if it isn’t too thick."
