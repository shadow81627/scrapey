Put the mince, onions, garlic, coriander, parsley, paprika, lemon juice and zest, tomato purée, pine nuts, eggs, and flour in a mixing bowl and season well with salt and black pepper. Mix well, then mash with your hands to form a chunky paste. Carefully remove a spoonful of the mixture, and roughly shape into a ball. Repeat with the rest of the mixture - you should get 32 meatballs in all."

Add the tomatoes and fennel seeds, stir well to combine, then season with plenty of salt and black pepper. Return the meatballs to the pan and stir well to coat with the sauce. Add the remaining oil, cover with a lid, and put in the oven for 1 hour. Serve hot from the pan with fresh crusty bread and a green salad."
