    "1 Tbsp vegetable oil ($0.02)",
    "2 links 8 oz. Mexican Chorizo ($1.67)",
    "4 boneless skinless chicken thighs about 1 1/4 lbs. ($2.35)",
    "12 oz. bag frozen onion, bell pepper, celery mix ($1.39)",
    "2 Tbsp tomato paste ($0.12)",
    "2 1/2 cups dry long grain white rice ($0.83)",
    "1 15 oz. can diced tomatoes ($0.89)",
    "4 cups chicken broth ($0.52)",
    "1 whole bay leaf ($0.15)",
    "1 tsp cumin ($0.10)",

      "text": "Cut the chicken thighs into small, one inch chunks. Add the vegetable oil to a large pot along with the chopped chicken thighs and chorizo (squeeze the chorizo out of the casing). Cook the meat over medium heat until the chorizo is browned and the chicken is white and firm (about 7-10 minutes). Drain off the excess fat. Add the frozen, chopped onion, celery, and bell pepper mix. Stir to combine and heat through (about 1-2 minutes)."

      "text": "Add the tomato paste and dry rice to the pot. Stir and cook for about two minutes. You should hear the rice crackling and popping as it cooks. This toasts the rice and caramelizes the tomato paste for more flavor. It's okay if it begins to coat the bottom of the pot, but don't let it burn."

      "text": "Add the chicken broth and diced tomatoes (with juices) to the pot. Stir to combine and dissolve anything stuck to the bottom of the pot. Finally, add the bay leaf, cumin, smoked paprika, and oregano. Stir once more, place a lid on the pot, and turn the heat up to high. As soon as the pot reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let it simmer for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes, turn the heat off and let the pot sit for an additional 10 minutes, undisturbed, to continue to steam."
