    "description": "Irish Potato Cakes with Avocado Basil Ranch. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2016/03/irish-potato-cakes-with-avocado-basil-ranch.html\n\n\nThese Irish potato cakes are made with a mixture of mashed and grated potatoes for a cake that is part pancake, part hash brown. \n\nThe pancakes generally use egg and butter and can be flavored with scallions. I use flax as the egg substitute. These cakes come together easily. Boil and mash half the potatoes, grate the rest. Mix in, add some flour, egg sub, salt, pepper, other flavors of choice, and cook on the pan until golden. Serve with vegan ranch or other dressings of choice. \n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic:  Doing Just fine by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/",
