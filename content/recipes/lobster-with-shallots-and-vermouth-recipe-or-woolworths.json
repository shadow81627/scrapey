      "text": "Lay one lobster on its back. Cut in half, beginning at the head, down through the line between the claws, unfurling the tail as you cut until the lobster can be separated into two. Repeat with the second lobster. Take out the black, thread-like intestine that runs down the tail and the small whitish sac in the top of the head. Leave the greeny liver."

Peel away the shell and lift out the white meat, discarding the white, oval membrane in the centre of the claw. Twist off the small claws, taking care not to tear off body meat, and discard."
