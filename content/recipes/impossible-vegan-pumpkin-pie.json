    "1 1/2 cups soy milk or other non-dairy milk",
    "1 tablespoon Ener-G egg replacer (see Notes)",

    "1 tablespoon cornstarch",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla",
    "2 cups pureed or mashed cooked pumpkin, cushaw, or winter squash (or canned pumpkin), see Notes)",

    "2 teaspoon baking powder",
    "3/4 cup sugar",
    "1/4 teaspoon ginger powder",

Add the remaining ingredients and blend on high for 2 minutes, stopping to scrape the sides a couple of times to make sure everything is thoroughly blended. Pour into a pie pan and bake for about 60 minutes. The top and edges should be brown, but the edges should not be over-done. (Since this is a custardy pie, using the standard toothpick or knife test does not work; it will remain somewhat moist in the center, but it shouldn’t be uncooked.)"
