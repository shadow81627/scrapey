  "description": "The air fryer makes this black-eyed pea snack crunchy in minutes, but you can also make them in an oven or toaster oven. See the notes below. The recipe depends on having firm, intact black-eyed peas, so if yours are mushy and falling apart, save them for another use.",

Spread them out on a plate and discard any smashed or mushy peas. (If there are too many mushy peas, try this recipe using a different brand and use these peas for something else.)"

      "text": "Preheat your air fryer to 350-360 F. Put the peas in the basket and air fry for 5 minutes. Remove the basket and shake or stir to redistribute the peas. Air fry for another 5 minutes or until peas are crunchy on the outside and slightly tender on the inside. Allow to cool and serve immediately. Note: these get soft quickly, so try to serve them as close as possible to air-frying or reheat for a minute or two in the air fryer or oven just before serving."
