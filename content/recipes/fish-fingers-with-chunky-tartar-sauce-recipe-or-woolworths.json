  "recipeIngredient": [
    "675g thick white fish fillets, such as haddock, sustainable cod, or pollack, skinned (loin works best)",
    "1-2 tbs plain flour",
    "1 egg, lightly beaten",
    "115g fresh breadcrumbs, toasted",
    "60g Parmesan cheese, finely grated",
    "1 pinch salt",
    "1 pinch freshly ground black pepper",

Use the breadcrumb mixture to coat each of the fish fingers. Make sure that you coat them well, as it protects the fish while it's cooking."
