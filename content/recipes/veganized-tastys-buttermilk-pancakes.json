Pour the milk mixture into the dry mixture and gently fold. Now add the aquafaba and continue to fold. Don't overmix the batter, it should be very lumpy. Let the batter rest for 15 to 30 minutes. Side note: I found this resting time didn't make much of a difference, so skip if you prefer."

For extra thick pancakes, do not spread the batter. Cook a few minutes until the bottom is browned and bubbles appear on the top of the pancake. Flip and cook 1 to 2 minutes more on the other side. Repeat with the remaining batter."
