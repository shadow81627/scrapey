    "400g adzuki beans, drained and rinsed",
    "400g chickpeas, drained and rinsed",
    "1 onion, roughly chopped",
    "6 salted anchovies in olive oil, drained",
    "1 tbs wholegrain mustard",
    "1 pinch salt",

      "text": "Add the onion, anchovies, and mustard, and season well with salt and black pepper. Pulse again a few times. You want the mixture to be well combined, but not sloppy. Now add the eggs, and pulse again until combined. Add the flour (just enough to bind the burgers), and pulse until incorporated."

      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Once the oil is hot, spoon out a portion of the bean mixture (it makes 6 burgers) and, using lots of flour on your hands, form into a flattened burger before adding to the pan. Fry undisturbed for 2-3 minutes on each side until firm and golden. Cook in batches of 2 or 3 burgers at a time, forming the burgers as you go and adding more oil when needed. Serve hot, sandwiched in a bun with crisp lettuce and tomato ketchup."
