    "text": "A word on salt: This is one of those times where you want to use some of that fancy finishing salt. I especially recommend a large-flaked salt, such as Maldon. The reason for this is that the salt, which is sprinkled on the herb mixture just after baking, will retain it&#x27;s shape and texture. So when you bite into the salmon, you&#x27;ll get a hint of crunchiness and a burst of saltiness. It&#x27;s a simple step with a big payoff in texture and flavor.The herb layer isn&#x27;t prescriptive. Use whatever you have on hand, although parsley is always a good base herb. I didn&#x27;t have fresh dill on hand, so I used about 1/3 of the amount dried. The herbs don&#x27;t need to be finely minced. A rough chop is fine.The salmon is delicious served just out of the oven, or at room temperature. Leftovers make a delicious salmon salad when mixed with a small amount of mayo or thick yogurt. No additional seasoning is necessary, as the fish is already deeply flavored."

A thicker fillet will usually need a little longer time. Check for doneness at 20 minutes: Remove the tray of salmon from the oven and close the oven door. (Since the oven is at such a low heat, you want to keep the door closed as much as possible.) Place a knife tip in the thickest part of the salmon and gently pry it open. If the salmon separates into flakes, it's done. If not, return it to the oven for another five minutes."

To remove the skin (optional) work the edge of the spatula between the skin and the flesh. By gently wiggling, you should be able to lift the fillet clear of the skin. Sprinkle each fillet with the salt and serve."
