    "1 large sweet potato (, peeled and cubed)",
    "4 fat cloves garlic",
    "2 bay leaves",
    "1 tablespoon mixed dried herbs",
    "1-2 teaspoon dried chilli flakes (I used 2 as I like it spicy)",
    "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika",
    "1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "1/4 teaspoon cacao (, cocoa powder or 1 square of good quality dark chocolate (trust me here, it works!)",
    "1 teaspoon sugar (optional but brings out the flavours. Any sugar will do but I use coconut sugar)",

      "text": "If you don't have a slow cooker you can also cook this in a pan or in the oven. Start by sautéing the onions and garlic then add all of the other ingredients. I don't use any oil and just use a dry pan but if you want to use a little oil that's fine too. Simmer for as long as you can to get the best flavour but at least until the beans are tender, 3 hours at least, less if you are using pre-cooked or canned beans. If using canned it could be ready in as little as 40 minutes. The longer it simmers the better it will be though! If cooking in the oven set oven to 300°F and cook until the beans are tender and the sauce rich and thick."
