Using a wooden spoon, stir the egg mixture, incorporating the flour a little at a time as you go and gradually adding half the remaining milk. When all the flour has been mixed in, add the remaining milk, and whisk with a balloon whisk to ensure there are no lumps. Transfer to a jug, and put in the refrigerator to rest for 30 minutes."
