    "420 ml / 1 3/4 cups water (, use 2 cups if cooking on a stove top)",
    "80 ml / 1/3 cup coconut aminos (, or low sodium soy sauce (be sure to use gluten-free soy sauce to make this recipe gluten-free)",
    "60 ml / 1/4 cup rice vinegar",

If you are using white rice, simply turn the vent to the sealed position and press the \"RICE\" button. Let the pressure release naturally then open, add the peas and stir before loosely putting the lid back on (you don't need to seal it) and allow it to sit for 1 - 2 minutes so the peas can cook in the residual heat. Serve immediately."
