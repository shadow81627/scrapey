Scoop out a tablespoon of the dough and roll into a ball, continue the process with the rest of the dough, making sure to separate the cookie dough an inch apart on the cookie sheet to leave room for the cookies to expand. Bake for approximately 15 minutes, or until they turn into puffy discs and are firm to the touch. Cool on a wire rack."
