Vegan Pumpkin Ginger Cookies with gingerbread spices and pumpkin. \n\nThese Ginger Cookies are soft, fudgy, blondie like with flavors from the Pumpkin, Ginger bread spices and molasses. They come together very quickly, are almost one bowl if you use a sifter. Even with 2 bowls used, you need to wash only 1.\n\nPumpkin adds a softness to the cookies which bakes up to a fudgy cookie texture compared to the snappy crisp molasses cookies. Bake them longer for a more cookie like crumb and less for fudgier. Use spices of choice like ginger bread, pumpkin pie spice or chai spice. Add some candied ginger or orange, or chocolate chips or nuts for variation.\n\n******MORE BREADS AND ROLLS FROM THE BLOG******\n\nLEMON COOKIES WITH CHIA SEEDS: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-lemon-cookies-chia/\n\nPEANUT BUTTER CHICKPEA COOKIE PIE: https://www.veganricha.com/peanut-butter-chickpea-cookie-pie/\n\nALMOND BUTTER OATMEAL BREAKFAST COOKIES: https://www.veganricha.com/almond-butter-oatmeal-cookies-vegan/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n #pumpkingingersnaps #pumpkinrecipe #vegancookies #veganricha #easyveganrecipes",
