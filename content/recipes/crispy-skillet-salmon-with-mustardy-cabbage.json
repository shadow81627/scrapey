Place the salmon skin-side down in the skillet, then press down on them so that the skin is in even contact with the pan and browns evenly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook undisturbed, gently pressing down on fish occasionally, until the sides are cooked halfway up the fillets, 6 to 9 minutes. Flip and cook until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the thickest fillet registers 120°F to 130°F for medium-rare, or 135°F to 145°F if you prefer it more well-done, 2 to 5 minutes more. Transfer skin-side up to a plate."
