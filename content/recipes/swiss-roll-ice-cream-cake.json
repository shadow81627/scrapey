    "text": "Make ahead: The cake can be baked, filled, rolled, and frozen up to 1 week ahead. Apply the magic shell just before serving. Storage: The chocolate-coated cake will keep tightly wrapped in plastic wrap in the freezer for up to a week. Unwrap and let sit about 20 minutes at room temperature before serving so that the shell softens and does not crack when you slice it."

Starting at a short end, gently roll up the cake along with the dish towel. Place the rolled-up cake seam-side down on a wire rack and let cool until room temperature, at least 30 minutes.

Gently re-roll the cake without the towel. Arrange seam-side down. Tightly wrap the roll in plastic wrap, manipulating the cake a bit once wrapped to tighten up the roll and push together any cracks. Freeze until the ice cream hardens, at least 4 hours or up to 1 week. About 20 minutes before serving, make the magic shell."
