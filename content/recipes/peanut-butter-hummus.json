    "1 teaspoon freshly grated ginger",

    "Juice of 2 limes, or lemons",

      "text": "Prepare the chickpeas, this step is optional, but I like to boil my chickpeas before adding to the hummus. This makes them soft and warm, which helps create a super creamy hummus. I like to boil them with a small amount of baking soda because the baking soda helps break down the chickpea skins. I then drain and rinse the chickpeas and pick out any visible skins that have come off the chickpeas."
