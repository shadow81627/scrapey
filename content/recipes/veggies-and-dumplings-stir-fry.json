Stir-fry just until the veggies begin to soften, about 2 minutes. Add the baby bok choy and continue to stir-fry until it begins to wilt and the carrots and corn are tender-crisp, about 2 minutes more. Add the dumplings and hoisin sauce mixture. Gently flip everything a few times to coat it with the sauce, then remove from heat."
