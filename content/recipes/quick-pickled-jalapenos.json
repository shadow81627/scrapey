    "4 medium (green or red) jalapeños, stems removed, thinly sliced into rings (4 medium jalapeños yield ~2 cups or 200 g)",
    "2 tsp olive or avocado oil (if oil-free, use water and add more as needed)",
    "1/2 small white or yellow onion, peeled and diced (1/2 small onion yields ~2/3 cup or 90 g)",
    "3 cloves garlic, minced",
    "3/4 tsp cumin seeds (optional)",
    "3/4 cup water",
    "3/4 cup distilled white vinegar",
