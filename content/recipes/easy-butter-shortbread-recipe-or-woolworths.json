      "text": "Divide the dough into 2 equal portions. Shape 1 portion of dough into a 20cm diameter disc directly on one baking tray. You can then either pinch the edges to make a fluted design or use the round end of a butter knife (as I did). Using a sharp knife, score the disc into 8 wedges (but don't cut all the way through) and then use a fork to prick the dough all over. Do the same with the second piece of dough. Sprinkle both discs with extra sugar."

      "text": "Bake the shortbread in the oven for 40 minutes, swapping the trays halfway through cooking. Let them cool on the tray for 10 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to completely cool. They will be soft when they first come out of the oven so will need to firm up a little before you put them on the wire rack. Cut into wedges to serve."
