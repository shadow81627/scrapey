Cook, stirring often, until the squash is tender when pierced with a fork, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, measure out 1 cup apple cider in a 2 cup or larger liquid measuring cup. Add 1 tablespoon dark brown sugar or maple syrup, 1 tablespoon whole-grain mustard, and 1 tablespoon balsamic or apple cider vinegar and whisk with a fork to combine."
