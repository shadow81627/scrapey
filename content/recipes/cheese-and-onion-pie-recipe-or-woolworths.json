Add the onion and a pinch of salt, and sweat for a couple of minutes until transparent and just starting to soften. Tip into a bowl, and leave to cool completely. Lightly beat one of the eggs, and stir into the cooled onion with the cheese. Season with salt and black pepper."

      "text": "Halve the pastry, and roll out each piece on a floured work surface. Use one of the pastry circles to line the pie tin, overlapping the edges, and fill with the cheese and onion mixture. Wet the edge of the pastry with a little water, then top with the other round of pastry. Trim away the excess, then pinch the edges together with your finger and thumb to seal. Using a sharp knife, make two slits in the top of the pie to allow steam to escape."
