  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 medium eggplant (as narrow as possible)*)",
    "1/4 cup unbleached all-purpose flour (or other flour of choice - GF for gluten-free eaters)",
    "1 cup panko breadcrumbs (GF for gluten-free eaters)",
    "2 Tbsp vegan parmesan",
    "1 tsp dried oregano (or double the amount if using fresh oregano)",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1/2 cup unsweetened plain almond milk (or other neutral milk)",
    "1 tsp cornstarch",
    "8 ounces pasta (such as linguini, but any kind will do, including veggie noodles or gluten-free)",
    "2 cups marinara sauce"

      "text": "Let rest for 15 minutes, then rinse and arrange on a clean absorbent kitchen towel. Top with another clean dish towel and lay a baking sheet on top. Place something heavy on top, such as a cast iron skillet, to thoroughly dry for at least 10 minutes."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "In the meantime, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with foil and spritz with nonstick spray. Also, if making pasta, bring water to a boil in a large saucepan."

Once hot, add 2 Tbsp olive oil (or sub avocado oil // adjust amount if altering default number of servings) and pull 3-4 eggplant rounds out of the oven at a time and sauté to give them extra crisp and texture. Cook for ~2 minutes on each side (or browned) and then return to oven to continue crisping. Do this in batches until all rounds are browned."
