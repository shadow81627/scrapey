  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 1/2 tsp avocado oil",
    "1 large sweet potato, sliced into 1/4-inch rounds (skin on)",
    "1 cup shiitake mushrooms (dry stalks removed, roughly chopped)",
    "1 dash coconut aminos",
    "1 cup shredded red cabbage",
    "1 tsp curry powder (or store-bought)",
    "1 healthy pinch sea salt, plus more to taste",
    "6 stalks curly kale, chopped (large, stalky stems removed)",
    "2 large eggs* (farm fresh / pasture-raised and organic whenever possible)",
    "1 pinch each sea salt + black pepper",
    "4 Tbsp hummus, divided",
    "1/3 cup sprouts (we love broccoli sprouts)",
    "Freshly chopped parsley (optional)"

Cook for 4 minutes or until underside is golden brown. Then flip and cover again. Cook for another 3 minutes or until sweet potatoes are tender."

Then add mushrooms to one half of the pan and season with a dash of coconut aminos. Then add cabbage to the other half of the pan and season with curry powder and salt. Toss to coat and cover to cook until tender — about 5 minutes — stirring occasionally."

Sauté for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally until wilted and bright green. Transfer to serving bowls but keep the heat on. Quickly crack eggs into the still-warm pan and season with a pinch each salt and pepper. Cook for about 1 minute over medium heat, then cover and cook another 2-3 minutes to cook the white but keep the yolk runny (our favorite method)."
