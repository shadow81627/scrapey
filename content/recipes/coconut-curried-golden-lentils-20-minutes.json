      "text": "Note: Soaking lentils is optional but can improve digestibility and speed cook time. See notes for tips.Bring water to a boil in a large pot or saucepan. Add lentils and bring back to a boil. Once boiling, reduce heat to a simmer and cook lentils uncovered for 4-5 minutes or until just tender. Then drain and set aside. Be careful not to overcook or they can become mushy (cooking time will vary by variety of lentil - check package for instructions)."

Once hot, add oil or water, shallot (optional), garlic, and ginger (start with lesser quantity, and add more to taste as desired). Sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.
