    "description": "In the hierarchy of appetizers you will find bruschetta, with it's juicy chopped tomatoes, sweet basil, and pop of tangy balsamic, firmly planted at the top of my list — especially now when near-perfect summer tomatoes are still hanging around.\n\nPlump and perfectly ripe summer tomatoes are best served simply, allowing their naturally sweet flavor and impressive juiciness to shine. That's why our favorite tomato preparations require minimal ingredients: white bread topped with mayo and tomatoes, tomatoes tossed with red wine vinegar and fresh herbs, and, of course, tomato bruschetta — the classic Italian appetizer that's practically summer on a platter.",
