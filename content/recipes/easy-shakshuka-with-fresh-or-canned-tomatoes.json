    "1 tsp ground cumin",
    "1 tsp sweet paprika",
    "1/4-1/2 tsp red pepper flakes",

Taste and adjust as needed, adding more cumin for smokiness, red pepper flakes for heat, or salt for overall flavor."

A satisfying, comforting, subtly spicy 1-pot meal suitable for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-shakshuka-with-fresh-or-canned-tomatoes/\n\nShakshuka (also spelled shakshouka) is a dish consisting of poached eggs cooked over a spiced tomato and pepper-based sauce. Its exact origin is hotly debated, but the dish is believed to have originated in Northwest Africa in a region called Maghreb that includes Algeria, Libya, Morocco, Tunisia, and other countries.\n\nIts popularity later spread to Israel where it was embraced as a hearty, inexpensive, and simple dish. In Jewish culture, it’s made for breakfast using the leftover tomato stew from the Sabbath dinner.\n\nThis is an easy, dairy-free version using fresh tomatoes, with an option to use canned if preferred!\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
