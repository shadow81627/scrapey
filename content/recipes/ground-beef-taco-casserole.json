    "description": "My love for classic ground beef tacos — you know, the kind with the signature seasoning pack, topped with crunchy romaine, chopped tomatoes, and bright-orange cheddar — runs deep. Until recently, I didn't think there was any way to top them. But then I took all the elements that make them so amazing and turned them into a weeknight casserole. It has a cheesy beef and bean base laced with warm spices, and then is topped as a classic taco should be, with lettuce, tomato, and creamy Greek yogurt.",
