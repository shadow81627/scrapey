If you are using water to sauté, you will need to add a little more water every few minutes to prevent the onion and celery from sticking."

Stir well to combine, allow to come to a simmer and cook for another 20 minutes. Add a little water to adjust the consistency to your liking, check the seasoning and adjust to taste; then serve. I like the soup chunky, but you can use an immersion blender right in the pan to make it smoother and creamier, if you want to."
