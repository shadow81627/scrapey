  "description": "Soft, melty grilled cheese topped with herbaceous chimicurri is a staple appetizer in Argentinean cuisine. This version uses what you&#x27;re most likely to find in an American grocery store, but is still super delicious. ",
  "headline": "Cast Iron Provoleta with Chimichurri",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: The chimichurri can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container with some plastic wrap pressed onto the surface to keep it from browning.Broiler method: Arrange an oven rack 6 to 8 inches from the broiler element and heat the broiler to high. Heat a small cast-iron skillet or oven-safe frying pan on the stovetop over medium-high heat. Place the provolone directly into the skillet and cook until the bottom edges start to melt and bubble, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Immediately transfer to the oven and broil until the top has browned in spots and the cheese is very soft and melty, 3 to 5 minutes more."
