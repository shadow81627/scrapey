    "text": "Egg separating tip: Eggs separate better when they are cold, rather than at room temperature, so separate them right after removing them from the fridge. This is key in any recipe that involves whipping egg whites (like this one) because if you get any yolk mixed in with your whites, they won&#x27;t whip as well as they might."

Bake until the cake has risen ever-so-slightly in the center and is set enough in the center that it will not jiggle when the pan moves; a cake tester will not come out clean, 34 to 37 minutes. The top will have formed an extremely thin, but discernible, crust. The cake will pull away from the side of the pan while it cools; don't let it bake until it pulls away from the side of the pan while in the oven or it will be overdone. Cool completely on a wire rack for at least 1 1/2 hours. Remove the side of the pan and serve with melted chocolate and ice cream if desired."
