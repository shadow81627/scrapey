Bake, turning halfway through cooking time, for 15-20 minutes or until golden and cooked through. Tip 1: The meatballs can be prepared a day ahead and cooked on the day. Tip 2: Hall of fame: Created with Jamie Christmas Citrus & Herb Turkey Breast, marinated in zesty lemon and herbs, is a guaranteed crowd pleaser. Find it in the freezer section."
