  "description": "This vegan pie crust recipe is flavourful, flaky, and made with vegan butter. When baked it has the most beautiful golden color. It&#039;s perfect for making sweet and savory pies. It&#039;s quick and easy to make (especially when using a food processor), requires only 4 ingredients, and it can also be made ahead of time and stored in the fridge, or freezer!",

Scatter the vegan butter cubes over the flour and pulse several more times until the mixture is a crumbly sandy texture. Pour over the plant-based milk and pulse a few more times until you reach a shaggy dough but there is still some unmixed flour (don't over mix or the dough will become tough). Turn the dough onto a clean work surface and use your hands to gather everything into a ball of dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 20 minutes before continuing.Bowl method: Add the flour and sugar into a large bowl and whisk to combine. Scatter the vegan butter cubes over the flour and use a fork or pastry cutter to cute the butter into the flour until you reach a crumbly sandy texture. Drizzle the plant-based milk across the flour mixture and use the fork to combine, until you reach a shaggy dough but there is still some unmixed flour (don't over mix or the dough will become tough). Turn the dough onto a clean work surface and use your hands to gather everything into a ball of dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 20 minutes before continuing."
