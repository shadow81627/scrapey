Tip 1: Gow gee wrappers are available in the refrigerated cabinet in Woolworths. You can also use wanton wrappers or fresh lasagne sheets, and cook until tender. Tip 2: To ‘bruise’ lemongrass, lay it on a chopping board and hit with a rolling pin. This splits the lemongrass, allowing the flavour to be released."
