Served brushed with garlic butter â€“ so good!\n\nMy favorite part about going to an Indian restaurant is when that big stack of butter naan arrives. You can always find different kinds of Naan on the menu â€“ some are stuffed and some are plain. While Plain Naan is obviously delicious Stuffed Naan is a treat that I have a difficult time saying no to. There are different types of Stuffed Naan with the most popular ones having fillings with Potato, Paneer, onion, Cauliflower, spinach, cheese etc. Unfortunately most Indian restaurants donâ€™t offer vegan versions.  Today, I have decided to bring to you my favorite stuffed naan â€“ Vegan Potato Spinach & Cheese Stuffed Naan. Itâ€™s aloo paratha + greens and herbs + cheesy goodness + stuffed in bread!
