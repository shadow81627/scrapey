Place the egg whites in a bowl with a pinch of salt and whisk with an electric hand whisk until soft peaks form. Whisk in the sugar 1 tablespoon at a time until the mixture is stiff and shiny. Spoon into the Swiss roll tin and smooth into the corners. Scatter the flaked almonds over the top, then bake for 15-20 minutes, or until just firm to the touch and golden. Turn the meringue out on to a sheet of baking parchment dusted with icing sugar, and leave to cool."
