    "description": "Cacio e pepe hails from Rome and its surrounding areas.

But because the ingredients are so simple, the specifics of each really matter.\n\nThis step-by-step recipe is foolproof. I've cooked my way through basically every cacio e pepe recipe out there, which has led me to this easy-as-can-be version that works every time. Here's everything you need to know.\n\nSee full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/cacio-e-pepe-2-22994320)",
