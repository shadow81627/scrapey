      "text": "To prepare the quinoa, heat the oil in a medium-size saucepan. Add the quinoa and cook over medium heat for 1-2 minutes, stirring often, so it's well coated with the oil. Add 1 1/3 cups of water and the salt. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 15-20 minutes, or until the water has been absorbed and the quinoa is tender but not mushy. Remove from the heat, let sit, covered for 5 minutes, then fluff with a fork. Set aside"
