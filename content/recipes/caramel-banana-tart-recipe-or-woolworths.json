    "75g butter",
    "150g golden syrup",

      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Put the butter and syrup in a small, heavy-based pan and heat until the butter has melted and the mixture is smooth, then allow to boil for 1 minute. Pour into the tart dish or tin. Arrange the banana slices on top of the syrup mixture - this will be the top of the pudding when it’s turned out. Place the dish or tin on a baking tray and bake for 10 minutes."

      "text": "Carefully remove the tart from the oven and place the pastry circle on top. Use the handle of a small knife to tuck the edge down into the tin, being careful of the hot caramel. Return the tart to the oven and bake for a further 20-25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to stand for 5-10 minutes, then place a serving plate on top and turn the tart upside-down. Serve with vanilla ice cream."
