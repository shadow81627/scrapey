  "recipeIngredient": [
    "3 cups dairy-free milk (preferably homemade // we love a cashew-almond blend — see instructions)",
    "1 14-oz can full-fat coconut milk (use light for lighter eggnog)",
    "4-6 Tbsp maple syrup, plus more to taste (substitute up to half with coconut sugar)",
    "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon, plus more to taste",
    "1/4 tsp ground nutmeg, plus more to taste",
    "1 tsp pure vanilla extract",
    "1/8 tsp ground cardamom (optional)",
    "1 ounce bourbon (per 8-ounce serving)",
    "Coconut whipped cream",
    "Cinnamon or nutmeg"

      "text": "Optional: If making your own dairy-free milk, soak nuts of choice overnight in cool water or cover with hot water and soak for 1 hour. Then drain, rinse well, and add to a high speed blender along with desired amount of filtered water (for a creamier milk, we went with 3/4 cup (90 g) raw soaked cashews, 3/4 cup (95 g) raw soaked almonds, and 4 cups (946 ml) water as the recipe is written; adjust amounts as needed if adjusting serving size). Strain through a nut milk bag and set aside."

      "text": "To a high-speed blender, add 3 cups (710 ml) dairy-free milk (as recipe is written, adjust amounts as needed if adjusting serving size), coconut milk, maple syrup (starting with the lesser amount), cinnamon, ground nutmeg, vanilla extract, and cardamom (optional)."

      "text": "For serving, enjoy cold, over ice, or hot by heating over medium heat until warm (we prefer chilled, no ice). Optionally, you can add 1/2 - 1 ounce bourbon per 1 cup (8-ounce) serving. This is optional, but a festive addition! Serve as is or with coconut whipped cream and a pinch more cinnamon or nutmeg."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Transfer remaining eggnog to a jar for storing. Leftovers should keep in the refrigerator up to 4-5 days. Or freeze into ice cubes and store up to 1 month. Shake well before serving — a little separation is natural."
