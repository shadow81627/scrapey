When the popping starts to subside, add 5 fresh curry leaves. Immediately cover the pan, as moisture from curry leaves will cause the oil to spurt. Once the sputtering stops, stir to evenly coat everything with oil and continue to fry for 10 seconds. Turn off the heat. Pour the spiced oil over the butternut shrimp curry. Serve with cooked rice."
