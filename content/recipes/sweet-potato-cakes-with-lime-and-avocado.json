    "1 small red onion (finely chopped)",
    "2 garlic cloves (crushed)",
    "1- inch 2.5 cm piece fresh ginger root, peeled and finely grated",
    "2 tablespoons brown rice flour",
    "2 tablespoons cornstarch",
    "2 red chiles (1 finely chopped and 1 finely sliced)",
    "Sea salt and freshly ground black pepper",
    "Large handful of cilantro leaves (roughly chopped)",
    "1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons (90 ml olive oil or coconut butter, melted)",
    "2 ripe avocados (halved and pitted)",
    "2 limes (1 juiced and 1 quartered)"

Add one quarter of the potato mixture to each pan, or all of it to the large pan (it should sizzle loudly) and flatten firmly with a spatula. Reduce the heat to medium."
