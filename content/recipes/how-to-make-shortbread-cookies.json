Divide the dough into 2 even portions (about 10 ounces each) and shape each portion into a 6 1/2-inch-long log that is about 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Place each log on a sheet of plastic wrap at a long end, then roll up to completely wrap in plastic. Twist and tie the ends together. Wrap the dough logs in the parchment paper and freeze for 1 hour or until firm. The dough can be stored in the freezer for up to 1 month. Remove the dough logs from the freezer, unwrap, and slice into 1/4-inch-thick rounds. Bake as directed above."
