  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Salt: Use salt that is free of iodine and anti-caking agents, which can inhibit fermentation.Water: Chlorinated water can inhibit fermentation, so use spring, distilled, or filtered water if you can.Seafood flavor and vegetarian alternatives: Seafood gives kimchi an umami flavor. Different regions and families may use fish sauce, salted shrimp paste, oysters, and other seafood. Use about 2 tablespoons of fish sauce, salted shrimp paste, or a combination of the two. For vegetarian kimchi, I like using 3/4 teaspoon kelp powder mixed with 3 tablespoons water, or simply 3 tablespoons of water.Storage: Kimchi can be refrigerated for up to a few months. Use clean utensils each time to extract the kimchi from the jar."

Check the kimchi once a day, opening the jar and pressing down on the vegetables with a clean finger or spoon to keep them submerged under the brine. (This also releases gases produced during fermentation.) Taste a little at this point, too! When the kimchi tastes ripe enough for your liking, transfer the jar to the refrigerator. You may eat it right away, but it's best after another week or two."
