Add beans, water, lime juice, cumin and chipotle chili powder to skillet. Flip a few times to incorporate and cook for about 2 minutes, or until most of the water has cooked off. Remove from heat and mash about half of the beans lightly with a potato masher. Add a bit more water if needed. Season with salt and pepper to taste."

(You can also place each tortilla in a hot, dry skillet for a few minutes to soften up if you aren't into the microwave.) Place a tortilla onto a work surface and spoon about 3 tablespoons of bean mixture into the middle. Roll the tortilla around the filling and place taquito, seam side down, onto baking sheet. Repeat until all tortillas or filling are used."
