Serve with pav(dinner rolls), naan, roti, rice, or cauliflower rice for low carb. Naturally gluten-free. Nutfree Soyfree\n\nXacuti (pronounced shakuti) is a popular dish from Goan cuisine. Traditionally, this is a dish that is made with chicken or fish, but I love to use mushrooms here. There are a variety of spices in this recipe. There is also freshly grated coconut, which you can find in frozen section in Indian stores or use dried shredded coconut. Together all these flavors make a delicious, meaty dish that you can serve the traditional way with dinner rolls or add to tacos and wraps.\n\n******MORE INDIAN RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nVEGETABLE JALFREZI: https://www.veganricha.com/vegetable-jalfrezi-smoky-tangy-veggie/\n\nMASOOR DAL TADKA: https://www.veganricha.com/masoor-dal-tadka-indian-red-lentil-dal/\n\nTOFU BUTTER MASALA: https://www.veganricha.com/butter-tofu-paneer-tofu-butter-masala-recipe/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#mushroomcurry #mushroomxacuti #veganmushrromcurry #veganricha #easyveganrecipes",
