    "1 cup small brown or green lentils, such as Spanish Pardena or French Le Puy",
    "1 cup long-grain white rice or coarse cracked wheat (#3 grade)",
    "3 1/2 cups water, divided, plus more for rinsing",
    "1 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed",
    "2 large yellow onions",
    "1/4 cup neutral oil, such as canola or safflower",

Heat 1/4 cup neutral oil in a large frying pan or saucepan over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onions and season with 1/2 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Cook, stirring frequently to avoid burning, though some charring will occur in order to get them all thoroughly browned, until very deep golden brown (darker than caramelized onions), about 30 minutes total."
