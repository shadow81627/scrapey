    "text": "Baking gluten-free: As always, when it&#x27;s important that your baked goods are gluten-free, double-check all ingredients to make sure they are gluten-free — not just the grains.How to make almond meal at home: If you&#x27;d rather not buy almond meal, it&#x27;s easy to make it at home: simply take 1 cup of almonds and process in your food processor until they become a coarse meal. Be careful not to over-process (or you&#x27;ll have almond butter on your hands).Add millet for crunch: For a little added crunch, I love tossing in a handful of raw millet here. It compliments the subtle corn flavor perfectly, is naturally gluten-free, and gives these otherwise rather delicate muffins an additional layer of texture.Adaptation Ideas: If you prefer a different cheese or don&#x27;t care for roasted red peppers, these are easy to adapt. Feel free to use goat cheese or even grated cheddar if you prefer. And I&#x27;ve tried these with sun-dried tomato and they&#x27;re wonderful."
