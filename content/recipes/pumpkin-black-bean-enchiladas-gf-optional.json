    "description": "Smoky and satisfying black bean enchiladas with creamy pumpkin enchilada sauce! Plant-based and (optionally) gluten-free, with just 8 ingredients required!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/pumpkin-black-bean-enchiladas-gf-optional/\n\nIt’s believed that enchiladas may have originated from a similar Mayan dish called papadzules. But the first written recipe for enchiladas was in an 1831 cookbook called \"El Cocinero mexicano.\"\n\nTypically, enchiladas are made with meat, seafood, beans, cheese, potatoes, or vegetables stuffed in corn tortillas and topped with enchilada sauce. The word “enchilada” is a form of the verb “enchilar” which means “to season with chile.” And chilies are the heart of enchilada sauce!\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
