  "description": "Tender Brussels sprouts, scallions, and garlic give bold flavor to this incredibly simple dish that requires just one mixing dish, one spoon, and less than 10 ingredients. Mozzarella and parmesan give it an irresistibly gooey finish. Serve with veggies, crackers, bread, or chips, my favorite being tortilla chips.",
