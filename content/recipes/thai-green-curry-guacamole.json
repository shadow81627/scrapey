    "1/2 tbsp neutral oil (I used avocado oil)",
    "1 and 1/2 tbsp Thai green curry paste (check the label - some brands contain fish)",
    "1 tsp minced ginger",
    "1 clove garlic (minced)",
    "1 tsp soy sauce (omit for paleo/soy-free)",
    "6 tbsp freshly-squeezed lime juice (plus more to taste)",
    "1/2 tbsp rice vinegar (sub with more lime juice for paleo)",
    "2 ripe avocados",
    "1/2 shallot (minced)",
    "1/2 jalapeno or 1 small Thai chili (finely chopped)",
    "1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro leaves",
    "3-4 scallions (green and white parts, finely chopped)",
    "1 pinch ground coriander seed (optional)",
    "salt and pepper (to taste)",
    "pickled carrots (for serving (optional; see recipe below)",
    "3 carrots (peeled and thinly sliced (I used rainbow carrots)",
    "1/2 cup rice vinegar",
    "1/2 cup water",
    "2 tbsp coconut sugar or maple syrup",
    "1/2 tsp salt (or less if your rice vinegar is already seasoned)"

      "text": "Season with salt and pepper to taste, and top with a handful of chopped pickled carrots if using. You'll likely need plenty of salt to cut through the richness of the avocado. If not using the pickled carrots, you may also need another hit of acid (either lime juice or rice vinegar). Guacamole is a great exercise in seasoning skills! Best served immediately, at room temperature. Store leftovers in the refrigerator for up to 2 days by taking a sheet of plastic wrap and pressing it directly onto the surface of the guacamole to cover."
