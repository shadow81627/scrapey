    "3-4 clove garlic, (minced)",

      "text": "Begin by shaving the Brussels sprouts. Place the Brussels sprouts in a colander and thoroughly rinse them. Pat them dry and transfer to a large cutting board. Trim the bottoms off of the Brussels sprouts and remove any loose, dry, or browned outer leaves. Discard the bottoms and outer leaves. To shred them, hold the Brussels sprouts with the root end facing the cutting board. Using a sharp knife, carefully slice the sprouts thinly into small shavings. Pull apart any larger pieces by hand. Alternatively, you can use the shredder attachment of your food processor."

      "text": "To make the sherry reduction, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and saut√© for 30 seconds. Once the garlic is fragrant and golden, add the Sherry Cooking Wine. Bring to a boil and boil lightly for 5 minutes, until the sherry has reduced in volume and most of the alcohol is cooked off. You should be left with a sweet and acidic sherry syrup. Remove from heat and stir in the remaining olive oil, mustard, salt, and pepper. Taste and adjust seasonings."
