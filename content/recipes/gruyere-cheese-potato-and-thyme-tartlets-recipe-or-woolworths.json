      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface, and use to line the 4 tart tins. Trim away the excess, line the pastry shells with greaseproof paper, and fill with ceramic baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden. Remove the beans and paper, brush the bottom of each pastry shell with a little of the egg wash, and return to the oven for 2-3 minutes to crisp. Remove from the oven, and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C."
