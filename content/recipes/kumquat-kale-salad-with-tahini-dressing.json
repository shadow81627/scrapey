    "8-10 ounces curly kale (torn or chopped // large stems removed)",
    "5-6 kumquats, (very thinly sliced)",
    "1 cup fresh bread crumbs (I ground mine from a wheat baguette - use GF if gluten-free)",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil (divided)",
    "1/2 large lemon (juiced)",
    "1 pinch each salt and pepper",
    "1 Tbsp vegan parmesan cheese",
    "2 Tbsp chia seeds (or sub hemp seeds or poppy seeds)",
    "1/2 cup tahini",
    "1/2 large lemon (juiced // 1/2 large yields ~1 1/2 - 2 Tbsp)",
    "1 Tbsp orange (or kumquat) juice",
    "1-2 Tbsp maple syrup (plus more to taste)",
    "1 pinch salt",
    "Water or plain almond milk (to thin)"
