      "text": "Combine 3 tablespoons dark soy sauce, 2 tablespoons rice vinegar, 1 tablespoon mirin and 2 tablespoons caster sugar in a shallow bowl cut into bite-sized cubes and turn to coat. Leave to absorb the flavours for about 15 minutes or more. When ready to cook, turn the oven on to low and heat an ovenproof plate. Scatter 2 tablespoons cornflour over a separate plate. Remove the tofu from the marinade, reserving the marinade, and roll the tofu in the cornflour to coat. Heat a wide frying pan over a medium-high heat and add enough sunflower oil to cover the base. Fry the tofu, using tongs to turn, until dark golden and crisp all over."

Meanwhile, pour 1 litre vegetable stock into a medium saucepan with the reserved marinade and bring to the boil. Add 400 g asparagus tips, 50 g soya beans, 50 g frozen peas, 1 teaspoon grated fresh root ginger and 400 g straight-to-the-wok udon noodles and simmer about 3-4 minutes until the vegetables are just tender. Divide between 4 bowls and share out the tofu cubes between each. Top with 25 g roughly chopped coriander leaves and serve drizzled with a little chilli oil."
