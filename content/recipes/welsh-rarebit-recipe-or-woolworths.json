      "text": "Using Guinness will give you not only a fabulous rich flavour but it adds a deep caramel colour to the Rarebit. If you don't want to add the stout, use more milk or light cream in it's place. I have found it best to use a good quality sour dough or firm doughy bread to avoid the toast getting soggy beneath the sauce. Enjoy."
