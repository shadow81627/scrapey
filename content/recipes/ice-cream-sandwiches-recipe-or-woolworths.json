      "text": "Remove ice cream from freezer and fill a small heatproof bowl with hot water. Dip the 7cm round pastry cutter into water and cut out an ice cream filling. Place ice cream on top of one biscuit, sandwich with another biscuit and place on a tray. Repeat with remaining biscuits and ice cream. Transfer tray to the freezer and freeze for at least 30 minutes before serving. Dust with cocoa powder and icing sugar to serve. Tip 1: Replace the cookies and cream ice cream with 1 litre vanilla ice cream. Replace the chocolate biscuit rounds with 310g chocolate chip cookies. Use a round pastry cutter the same size as chocolate chip biscuits, sandwich together and freeze for 1015 minutes before serving. Tip 2: Replace the chocolate biscuit rounds with ice cream wafers. Tip 3: For an adult version serve the ice cream sandwiches drizzled with warmed chocolate fudge sauce."
