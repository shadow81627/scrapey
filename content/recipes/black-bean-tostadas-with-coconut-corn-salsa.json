  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Corn tortillas: Look for ones with no preservatives: just corn, lime, and salt in the ingredient list.To fry tostada shells: Fill a heavy-bottomed pot with a 1-inch layer of vegetable oil and heat over medium-high heat until very hot. To test, place a small piece of tortilla in the oil — if furious bubbles form around the edges and it floats to the top of the oil, the temperature is right. One at a time, fry tortillas for 1 to 2 minutes, flipping halfway through. The tortilla will puff up, become crispy, and turn golden-brown as it fries. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate and sprinkle with a little salt. Repeat with remaining tortillas."

Trim away the tough stems on the 1/2 bunch cilantro, then coarsely chop the leaves and tender stems (you should have about 1/2 cup tightly-packed chopped cilantro). Finely chop the jalapeño (you should have about 2 tablespoons; if you prefer less spice, use less, or seed it first). Place the cilantro and jalapeño in a large bowl."

Slice the kernels off the cob: I prefer to lay each ear on a cutting board and cut down the side of the cob to remove the kernels. Then, I rotate the cob so the flat (cut) end is against the board and continue cutting and rotating (you should have about 2 1/2 to 3 cups total); set aside."

Arrange 2 racks to divide the oven into thirds and heat the oven to 400°F. Divide the 8 tortillas between two baking sheets. Brush both sides of the tortillas with 1 tablespoon of the coconut oil. Bake, flipping the tortillas and rotating the baking sheets from top to bottom and back to front halfway through, until lightly browned and crisp, 12 to 14 minutes total. Meanwhile, heat the beans."
