    "2 onions (thinly sliced)",
    "1 puff pastry sheet (rolled into a large rectangle (about 9 x 12, but no need to be precise)",
    "1/2 cup shredded mozzarella or Italian-blend cheese",

Allow onions to slowly caramelize, stirring occasionally at first and more frequently once onions begin to brown. Depending on your stove, this could take anywhere between 30 minutes to an hour. Be patient—it's worth it! Remove from heat."
