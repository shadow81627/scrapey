  "recipeIngredient": [
    "10.5 oz (300 grams) silken tofu (, or soft tofu)",
    "1/2 cup (120 mls) unsweetened plant-based milk (, it must be unflavored)",
    "2 tablespoons nutritional yeast",
    "2 tablespoons almond flour",
    "slightly heaping 1/4 teaspoon ground turmeric",
    "1 teaspoon Dijon mustard",
    "2 teaspoons cornstarch (corn flour in the UK), arrowroot can be used instead)",
    "1 teaspoon Kala Namak (Indian Black Salt) (, plus more to taste. Can be omitted but you won't have the eggy taste)",
    "1/2 teaspoon fine salt (, plus more to taste)",
    "1/2 teaspoon black pepper (, plus more to taste)",
    "1/2 teaspoon onion powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "2 tablespoons vegan butter (, see notes for oil-free option)",
    "12 oz (350 grams) medium firm, firm or extra firm tofu (, depending how firm you want your \"egg\" pieces)"

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Warm a large sauté pan over a medium low heat and add the vegan butter. Let it melt then add the crumbled tofu. Allow it to cook in the butter for a minute or two and then pour in the blended tofu mixture. Stir it all up and keep stirring it every few minutes until the texture is as you like it. It's best when it is silky and very slightly runny. That takes about 5 minutes. The longer you cook it the drier it will get. It will continue to cook a little once you turn off the heat so bear that in mind."
