    "2.5 lb. Split turkey breast (bone-in, skin on) ($14.98)",
    "4 Tbsp butter, room temperature ($0.38)",
    "1 tsp dried sage ($0.10)",
    "1 tsp dried rosemary ($0.10)",
    "1 tsp dried thyme ($0.10)",
    "3/4 tsp salt ($0.03)",

      "text": "Pat the split turkey breast dry with a paper towel, then use your hand to separate the skin from the breast meat, leaving it intact on the sides, and creating a pocket to fill with the herb butter. Spread about 1/3 of the butter herb mixture under the skin. Spread the remaining herb butter on top of the skin and all over the exterior of the turkey breast."

      "text": "Transfer the casserole dish to the oven and roast the turkey for about 1.5 hours, or until the internal temperature reaches 165oF. Begin to check the turkey after 1 hour. If the top begins to brown too much before the internal temperature reaches its mark, cover the turkey with foil as it bakes (I did not need to do this). Make sure to test the temperature in the thickest part of the breast, without touching bone."

      "text": "Let the turkey breast rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Serve the roasted apples and onions along with the sliced breast and spoon the drippings over top."
