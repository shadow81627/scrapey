  "headline": "Better-than-Pie Sweet Potato Cheesecake",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Sweet potato substitution: 2 cups canned pumpkin purée or mashed pumpkin can be substituted for the sweet potatoes.Make ahead: This cheesecake can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated.Storage: Leftovers can be tightly wrapped and refrigerated for up to 3 days.Freezing cheesecake: To freeze the cheesecake, let the cheesecake cool to room temperature and do not make the whipped cream topping. To freeze the cheesecake on the springform pan base, remove the outer rim from the springform pan. Wrap the cheesecake and the bottom of the pan with a few layers of plastic wrap, then a final layer of aluminum foil. To freeze without the springform pan, slide a flat spatula underneath the crust to release it from the bottom of the pan. Carefully slide the cheesecake onto a cardboard round or large plate. Wrap it all in a few layers of plastic wrap, then in a final layer of aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 3 months and thaw overnight in the refrigerator before serving. Make and top the cheesecake with whipped cream right before serving."
