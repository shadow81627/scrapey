Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low and cook, stirring frequently, for 20 minutes or until mixture reaches 105°C on a sugar thermometer. Test jam by spooning a little onto a chilled saucer and leaving for 30 seconds, then gently push with your finger. If the top of the jam wrinkles and doesn’t run into the centre, it is ready. Otherwise, return to a simmer for a further 2-3 minutes and repeat testing process until thickened. Discard cinnamon and vanilla bean."
