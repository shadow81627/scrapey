  "description": "Just 2 ingredients and is super quick to make! This is the perfect recipe for anyone who cannot eat soy, or just wants to change it up a bit. The end result is a tofu that can be crisped up on the outside and is melt-in-your-mouth tender in the middle. You can use it 1 to 1 as a sub for soy tofu- season and cook it any way you like! Recipe inspired by: Plant You , PowerHungry, Nikki Vegan &amp; Happy Gut for Life",

      "text": "Add the boiling water, lentils, and salt (if using) to your blender. Let the lentils soak in the blender with the lid off for 15 minutes, or until the lentils look pale and softened. Once the lentils have softened, put the lid on the blender and blend the mixture until it is completely smooth. If the water is still hot, be careful when blending, start blending at the lowest speed, gradually increasing the speed to ensure it doesn't erupt."

      "text": "Once blended, pour the lentil mixture into a medium saucepan. Put over medium-high heat, and whisk continually as it cooks, until the lentil mixture gets thick, this will take about 5 minutes. It will start to set almost right away so working quickly, pour into a heat-safe container and spread evenly. I used a glass food storage container, but you could alternatively use a baking dish, or silicone baking mold. No need to grease your dish. Let the lentil tofu set and chill in the fridge. Once set you can cut and bake, fry, or air fry, just like soy tofu!"
