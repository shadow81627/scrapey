Place them in a blender or food processor and blitz until the fruits are coarsely combined and still have some texture. Divide between four freezer proof serving bowls (enamel bowls are freezer-safe) and place in the freezer for 3 hours. Alternatively, freeze the ice cream in a clean plastic container."
