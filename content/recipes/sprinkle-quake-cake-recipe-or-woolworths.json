Pat sprinkles into the line, then refrigerate cake for 30 minutes or until icing and sprinkles are firm. Reserve 1/2 cup blue icing and pipe remaining blue icing above and below sprinkles, ensuring it is thicker than the sprinkle layer. Scrape cake smooth using a cake scraper or edge of a clean ruler. Spoon reserved white and blue icing into opposite sides of a piping bag fitted with a star tip. Pipe peaks of combined icing on top of cake. Serve."
