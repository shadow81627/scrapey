      "text": "To butterfly a pork chop, place it on a cutting board. Using a sharp knife, make a horizontal incision, about 2.5 cm deep, down the length of the chop. Make sure that the top and bottom layers are of uniform thickness. Once you’ve cut the entire length, cut deeper into the loin, pulling back the top layer as you go, until you are about 2.5 cm from the edge. Open up the flaps, as you would a book, andlay them flat on the board. Remove any fat. Repeat for the remainingchops."

If you only have room to fry 2 at a time, keep the cooked ones warm in an oven at a low temperature, loosely covered with foil, while you fry the rest, adding a little extra oil and butter, if necessary."

Add the bacon and cook for a further 2 minutes until crisp. Finally, add the apple and sage, and cook for a further 2 minutes, or until the apple begins to soften."

Reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook the compote for about 5 minutes, or until the liquid has reduced, leaving a thick, rich sauce. Adjust the seasoning, if necessary, and serve alongside the pork chops, with the mashed potatoes and the collard greens."
