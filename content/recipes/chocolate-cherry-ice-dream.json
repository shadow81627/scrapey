  "description": "If you’re used to greens in your sweets, you can use kale leaves (ribs removed) instead of spinach, but if this is the first time you’ve added greens to a dessert, stick to spinach–you won’t know it’s there.",

    "2 cups raw spinach leaves (, loosely packed (optional)",
    "1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa or cacao powder",
    "1 tablespoon ground chia seed",
    "1 frozen banana (, cut into several pieces)",

      "text": "Place ingredients into high-speed blender in the order listed (a food processor may work if you omit the spinach). Begin blending on low and gradually increase the speed until you’re on the highest setting. If your blender has a tamper, use it to push the fruit into the blades. (This will be loud, so don’t worry if it sounds like a jackhammer fighting with a chain saw.) Blend until smooth but don’t over-blend or the friction will melt your Ice Dream. If that happens, call it a smoothie and use a straw."
