Add remaining crushed tomatoes, diced tomatoes, vegetable broth, and cashew mixture to skillet. Stir a few times to incorporate. Bring to a simmer and allow to cook for about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding a bit of water if mixture becomes too thick and begins to sputter. Add tofu back to skillet, along with peas. Cook just until tofu and peas are heated throughout, about 3 minutes. Season with additional garam masala, if desired, and salt to taste."
