    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "1 whole head garlic (, not individual cloves, the whole thing)",
    "2 large or about 2 heaping cups (300 grams) onion (, peeled, cut in half then sliced finely)",
    "2 teaspoons sugar",
    "12.3 oz (349 grams) silken tofu (, pack sizes vary a bit but as long as it's pretty close to this it's fine)",
    "1 tablespoon nutritional yeast",
    "2 teaspoons white miso paste (, optional - can be omitted but if you have some it's worth using it)",
    "1 tablespoon white wine vinegar (, or lemon juice)",
    "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt (, plus a little more to taste if necessary)",
    "1 teaspoon dried thyme (, you can use fresh instead if you have it and feel free to add more if you want a stronger type flavour)",
    "Up to 1/4 cup (60 mls) plant-based milk (, unsweetened & unflavoured)"
