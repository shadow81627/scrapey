Pulse until the butter is in small pieces with some larger pieces. While pulsing, pour the beaten egg through the feed hole and continue pulsing just until the dough starts to hold together. Turn out of the bowl onto a clean surface and press the dough together into one large ball. Divide the dough into two pieces, one slightly larger than the other. Form the smaller one into a disk shape and wrap tightly with plastic wrap. Place in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes."
