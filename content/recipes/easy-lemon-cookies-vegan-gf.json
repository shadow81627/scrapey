  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1/4 cup organic cane sugar",
    "2 tsp lemon zest (1 medium lemon yields ~2 tsp zest)",
    "1/2 cup brown rice flour",
    "1/2 cup almond flour",
    "1/4 cup tapioca flour (also called tapioca starch)",
    "1/8 tsp sea salt",
    "1/4 cup solid refined coconut oil* (unrefined is also okay, but cookies will have a slight coconut flavor)",
    "2 tsp lemon juice",
    "1 Tbsp dairy-free milk (we used almond)",
    "1/2 cup organic powdered sugar",
    "1 tsp dairy-free milk (we used almond)",
    "1 pinch lemon zest"

      "text": "In a medium mixing bowl, whisk together the sugar and lemon zest until well combined and fragrant. Add the brown rice flour, almond flour, tapioca flour, and salt, mixing until well combined. Add in the solid coconut oil and, with clean hands (or a pastry cutter or fork), begin mixing the solid coconut oil with the dry ingredients until no obvious lumps of coconut oil remain. The texture should look sandy and hold together in clumps when you squeeze it."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add the lemon juice and dairy-free milk and mix with a spatula or wooden spoon until combined. Resist the temptation to add more liquid — it’s okay if the dough is in separate pieces, as long as it’s moist."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Place a piece of parchment or wax paper on the counter and transfer the cookie dough onto the paper. Mold the dough together into a disc and wrap the paper around it. Place the dough in the refrigerator for 5-10 minutes to make it easier to roll out. Once chilled, place another piece of parchment or wax paper on top of the dough. Using a rolling pin, begin rolling the dough between the pieces of paper until it is 1/4-inch thick. Then, using a 2-inch circle cookie cutter, cut out as many cookies as possible (see notes below if you don’t have a cookie cutter). Use a spatula or butter knife to carefully transfer the cookies to the parchment-lined baking sheet. They won’t spread too much, so they should all fit on one large baking sheet."

      "@type": "HowToStep",

      "text": "Remove cookies from the oven and let cool for at least 10 minutes on the baking sheet. If you are glazing them, let them cool completely, then carefully dip the top of each cookie into the glaze and place on a plate or cooling rack to set."
