  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 tbs olive oil",
    "1kg red onions, peeled, halved, and sliced",
    "0.6 cup red wine",
    "3 tbs balsamic vinegar",
    "3 tbs white wine vinegar",
    "6 tbs light soft brown sugar",

      "text": "Heat the oil in a preserving pan or a large heavybased, stainless steel saucepan. Add the onions, the sea salt, and some freshly ground black pepper. Cook over a low-medium heat for about 30 minutes until the onions soften and turn translucent, stirring occasionally so they don’t catch and burn. Slow cooking is essential at this point, as this is where the delicious caramelly taste is developed."

      "text": "Raise the heat a little, add the wine and vinegars, and stir to combine. Bring to the boil, then reduce the heat, stir in the sugar, and cook on low heat, stirring occasionally, for a further 30–40 minutes until most of the liquid has evaporated."

      "text": "Remove the pan from the heat. Taste and adjust the seasoning as necessary (although the flavors will mature with time). Spoon into warm sterilized jars with nonmetallic or vinegar-proof lids, making sure there are no air gaps. Cover with waxed paper discs, seal, label, and store in the fridge to allow the flavors to mature for 1 month. Keep refrigerated after opening."
