    "description": "This deeply savory cauliflower soup is so creamy and comforting, you'd never guess it's dairy-free. Rather than milk, cream, or even a dairy alternative like coconut milk, this soup gets all of its richness from cauliflower itself. You'll roast it first to deepen its naturally nutty flavor, then blend it with broth to create ultra-smooth results. This is the soup you'll want to eat all fall long. \n\nSee full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/cauliflower-soup-recipe-23215391)",
