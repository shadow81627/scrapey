  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: You can scoop the dough out onto a lined baking sheet, pat it down, freeze until firm, and then pack the pucks in an airtight container and freeze for up to 2 months. Leave the pucks at room temperature while you heat the oven before baking.Storage: The blondies are best eaten soon after they&#x27;re baked, but they can be kept in a covered container at room temperature for up to 1 day. They can also be frozen, wrapped airtight, for up to 2 months.Reprinted with permission from Dorie&#x27;s Cookies by Dorie Greenspan, copyright (c) 2016.
