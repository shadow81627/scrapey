Add the capsicums and chicken allowing enough space to cook evenly, if you’re cooking on a small grill it’s best to cook in batches. Turn the capsicums once they start to blister and lightly char. Once the capsicums become soft, remove them from the grill and set them aside. Turn the chicken once light golden char marks develop, cook the other side then remove from the heat and set aside."
