    "3 Tbsp grape seed oil (or sub coconut oil)",
    "1 medium white or yellow onion, finely diced",
    "1 Tbsp ground cumin",
    "3/4 tsp sea salt (divided // plus more to taste)",
    "6 cloves garlic, minced (6 cloves yield ~3 Tbsp)",
    "2 Tbsp fresh ginger, minced",
    "1/2 cup fresh cilantro, chopped",
    "2-3 fresh green chilies, sliced with seeds (I used serrano peppers // reduce amount if you prefer less heat)",
    "1 Tbsp ground coriander",
    "1 tsp chili powder",
    "1 tsp ground turmeric",
    "1 28-ounce can pureed or finely diced tomatoes (if unsalted, you’ll add more salt to the dish)",
    "2 15-ounce cans chickpeas, slightly drained",
    "1 tsp garam masala* (see instructions for DIY blend)",
    "2-3 tsp coconut sugar",
    "2 Tbsp lemon juice (plus more to taste)"

Chana masala can be enjoyed as a stew on its own, or it can be delicious with white or brown rice (see my favorite method here), or cauliflower rice. Lastly, my favorite is over roasted sweet potatoes and broccoli (see notes for instructions)."
