Bake until lightly browned and very crisp, rotating the pans between racks halfway through, 6 to 8 minutes total. Keep an eye on them, as they can burn quickly."

Let cool completely before enjoying — they'll continue to crisp up as they cool. Serve in place of crackers alongside cheese or dip, crumble them over salad or pasta, or snack on them on their own."

    "description": "The first time I made these pepperoni chips for a dinner party with friends, I put them down alongside the cheese and olives, turned back into the kitchen to get my wine glass, and by the time I returned, the chips were gone. I really am not kidding. These crispy, crunchy, salty, spicy little guys are sure to be a hit among anyone you serve them to. Not only do they require just one ingredient, but they also happen to be gluten-free. Make a big batch to enjoy over happy hour, to pack up for a snack for the kids, or to munch on during the afternoon slump — they work no matter the occasion.",
