    "text": "Make ahead: The disk of pie dough can be stored for 3 days in the refrigerator or up to 1 month in the freezer. If frozen, defrost in the refrigerator overnight.Crushing cranberries by hand: If you don’t have a food processor, place 3 cups cranberries in a large ziptop bag and do your very best to break up the berries with the bottom of a saucepan. This step acts as therapy, and also releases some juice that will help thicken the filling as it bakes. Storage: The pie can be loosely covered and refrigerated up to 3 days."
