  "description": "Although figs lose their vibrant colour, turning greener if bottled, being macerated in honey syrup with lemon zest enhances their flavour. They are delicious served as a dessert with thick Greek yoghurt or cream, but also as a starter with cool, salty feta cheese.",

Lift the zest from the syrup and discard. Pour the hot syrup over the figs to cover completely. Tap each jar gently on a wooden board or work surface to remove any air bubbles."

      "text": "Tighten the screwband, if necessary. Leave for 24 hours and test for a seal. (If using Kilner jars with metal lids, you will know immediately or soon after processing if you have a seal as the lid becomes slightly concave and is firm with no “give” once pressed. You may even hear a “pop” as the seal forms.) Store in a cool, dark place. Once opened, store in the fridge."
