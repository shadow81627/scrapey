We recommend starting with celery, then cucumber, then herbs, then greens, and finishing with ginger, apple, and lemon. The apples and lemons seem to make a final pass through the juicer and push out any stubborn remnants that may have gotten lodged or stuck."

      "text": "Enjoy immediately or transfer to a jar, seal well, and refrigerate up to 24 to 48 hours. Nutrients are most potent when consumed as soon after juicing as possible. Not freezer friendly."
