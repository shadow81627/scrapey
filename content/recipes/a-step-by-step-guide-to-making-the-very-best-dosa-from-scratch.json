    "text": "Fermenting tip:  I usually put the bowls near my house plants as wild yeast helps to ferment the batter.Storage: The batter can be refrigerated up to a few days. Let come to room temperature before using, and stir well to recombine. This will ensure your dosas will have a nice golden color when cooked. I personally prefer to make dosas right after the batter has fermented, as it results in the best texture and color.Making paper dosas: To make a paper dosa, which is thinner and crunchier, you can use 1/4 cup batter and spread it thinner on the skillet.  Use your spatula to flatten the batter down once you have spread it for extra crispiness."

Do not let the batter overheat. To check that it has been blended well, drop a little into a bowl of water. If the batter rises to the top, it has been blended enough.

Add a couple drops of ghee or oil to the pan and lightly smear it all over with a paper towel or silicone pastry brush. If you have a sprayer for oil that will work best here. At this point, you don’t want to put too much ghee or oil, as this will make it difficult to spread the batter evenly. Sprinkle a few drops of water into the pan — if it sizzles, the pan is ready.
