    "1 yellow onion ($0.32)",
    "2 Tbsp butter ($0.26)",
    "1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2/3 lb.) ($3.62)",
    "1 cup long grain white rice ($0.62)",
    "1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)",
    "1/4 tsp dried sage ($0.03)",
    "1/4 tsp salt ($0.02)",
    "freshly cracked pepper ($0.03)",
    "3 cups chicken broth ($0.39)",
    "1/2 lb. frozen peas and carrots ($0.67)",
    "1/3 cup heavy cream ($0.26)",
    "4 oz. cheddar, shredded ($0.85)"

      "text": "While the onions are cooking, dice the chicken breast into small, 1/2-inch pieces. Add the chicken to the skillet and continue to sauté for about 3 minutes more, or just until the outside of the chicken pieces have turned opaque (the chicken will finish cooking through as it simmers with the rice)."

Once it reaches a full boil, turn the heat down to low and let the skillet simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, replacing the lid each time. Cooking the rice in an excess of broth and stirring occasionally as it cooks will produce a saucy rice mixture."

Stir in the frozen vegetables (no need to thaw), replace the lid, and let it sit over medium-low heat for another 5 minutes to heat the vegetables through. Finally, add the heavy cream, stir to combine, taste, and add extra salt if needed (this will depend on the salt content of the broth you used)."
