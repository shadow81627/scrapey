    "1/4 cup olive oil",
    "1 pound assorted fresh mushrooms, (I used a mix of button, cremini and shiitake, cleaned and chopped)",
    "1 medium onion, (diced)",
    "2 medium carrots, (diced)",
    "2 celery ribs, (diced)",
    "4 garlic cloves, (minced)",
    "1 cup dry white wine",
    "1 teaspoon dried thyme",
    "6 cups low sodium vegetable broth, (divided)",
    "1/2 cup dried pearl barley",
    "1/2 cup raw cashews, (soaked in water 4 to 8 hours and drained)",
    "1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons white miso paste, (optional but recommended)",

Allow to cook for about 5 minutes, flip and cook 5 minutes more, until most of the mushrooms are nicely browned. Add onion, carrot, celery, and garlic to the pot and saut­­é until vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes."

Add 5 cups of broth and barley to the pot. Raise heat again and bring to a boil. Lower heat and allow to simmer, uncovered, until the barley is tender, about 45 minutes."

Add the cashew mixture to the pot, along with soy sauce and miso, if using. Stir until all ingredients are fully incorporated, making sure to fully dissolve the miso. The soup will be very thick at this point. Thin it with some water if desired. Reheat for a minute or two, and season with salt and pepper to taste."
