  "description": "Use any combination of baking dishes–several smaller or two larger–but be sure they’re deep enough to hold about 1 1/2-inches worth of stew plus another inch for the topping. You can easily turn this into a shepherd’s pie by substituting mashed potatoes for the biscuit topping.",

Add additional soymilk or water a teaspoon at a time as you stir until all flour is moistened and dough forms a ball. Turn out onto floured board and knead two or three times. Roll out to 1/2- inch thick, and cut into circles using a 1 1/2-inch wide floured glass or biscuit cutter. Gather remaining dough and use it to cut additional biscuits.
