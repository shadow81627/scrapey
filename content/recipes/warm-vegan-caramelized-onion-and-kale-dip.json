  "description": "A warm vegan caramelized onion and kale dip served hot from the oven. Dairy-free recipe that's like a more sophisticated spinach artichoke dip but is also nutritious and high in protein! Updated in 2018 with MORE kale, NO blender, and MORE flavor! The entire recipe can be made in one dish if you use a cast iron skillet.",

      "text": "Reduce the heat to medium-low. Let the onions cook, stirring only every few minutes, until completely softened, about 15 minutes. Continue cooking and stirring infrequently until onions have turned golden brown and take on a sweet taste, another 15-25 minutes, depending on the exact size and temperature of your pan and onions. I normally do all of the rest of the prep for this recipe while the onions caramelize."
