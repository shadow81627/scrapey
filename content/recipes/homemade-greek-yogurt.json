Pour the yogurt into the strainer, then lightly fold over the overhang of cheesecloth to cover the yogurt. Refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight. The longer you strain, the thicker and more concentrated the Greek yogurt will be. When it has reached your desired consistency, the liquid (whey) does not need to be discarded; you can repurpose it for other uses."
