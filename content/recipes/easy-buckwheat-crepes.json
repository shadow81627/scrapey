    "text": "Make ahead: The crêpe batter can be made up to 2 days ahead and refrigerated. Let come to room temperature and stir well or reblend before using. Storage: The crêpes can be stacked and refrigerated in a zip-top bag or airtight container for up to 3 days. To freeze, place a small square (about 4-inches) of parchment or wax paper between each crêpe and freeze in a tightly sealed zip-top bag or airtight container for up to 1 month. Thaw overnight in the refrigerator before using. "
