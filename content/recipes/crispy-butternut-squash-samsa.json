Alternatively, the samsas can be assembled and refrigerated up to 4 hours before baking.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Reheat in a stainless steel or cast iron pan over medium-low heat until warmed through and the bottom is crisp, or in a 400ºF oven for 10 to 12 minutes."
