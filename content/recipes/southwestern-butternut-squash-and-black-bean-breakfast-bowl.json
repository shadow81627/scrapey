    "3 cups butternut squash, peeled and seeds removed, cut into 1 inch cubes (~1 small squash // or sub potatoes cut in 1/2-inch cubes)",

    "1/2 tsp each sea salt and pepper",
    "1/8 tsp garlic powder",
    "1 (15-oz.) can black beans, drained and rinsed",
    "1/4 cup Easy Red Enchilada Sauce (or sub store-bought)",
    "1/2 Tbsp avocado oil",
    "1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)",
    "5 cups baby spinach (a 5 oz. package yields ~5 cups)",
    "1/8 tsp sea salt",
    "2-4 large eggs (preferably pasture-raised, organic when possible)",
