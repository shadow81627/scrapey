      "text": "Stir in the beans and about 1/2 cup of water. Bring the mixture to a simmer and allow to cook, uncovered for about an hour, until the beans fall apart completely, adding more water to the skillet as it dries up during cooking. You can shorten the cook time and mash the beans with a fork if you prefer, but I find the texture is much nicer if you just let them simmer. Remove from heat and season with salt and pepper to taste."
