    "1 package tofu (14-16 ounces firm or extra-firm tofu, frozen and thawed (see note)",

    "3-4 cloves garlic (chopped)",
    "1 cup mushrooms (coarsely chopped)",
    "1/2 cup white wine (see note)",
    "1 cup vegetable broth (I used fatfree “chicken-style” bouillon)",

    "1 14- ounce can diced tomatoes (canned)",
    "1 teaspoon salt (or to taste)",
