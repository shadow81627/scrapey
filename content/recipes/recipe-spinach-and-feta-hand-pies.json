    "text": "Freezing the hand pies: Once they have cooled completely, wrap each individual hand pie tightly in plastic wrap. Transfer to a plastic freezer bag and freeze.Reheating the hand pies: Thaw hand pies for a few hours in the fridge, or extend the cooking time to reheat them straight from the freezer. If you put one in your lunch bag in the morning, it will be thawed enough by lunchtime. Unwrap from the plastic before reheating. Reheat in the microwave in 1-minute bursts on HIGH until heated through (2 to 3 minutes total), or in the oven or a toaster oven at 300°F until heated through."
