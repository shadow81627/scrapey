Season with a healthy pinch each salt and pepper and stir. Sauté for 3-4 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is translucent and fragrant.

Once the timer goes off, let the steam release naturally, or carefully press the quick release if in a hurry. NOTE: To keep this chili thick, we add less liquid so it is possible you may get a burn message. It is unlikely, but if it happens, leave it be for 1-2 minutes to see if the burn message fixes itself. Otherwise, take note of the remaining time, press cancel, quick release pressure, add 1/2 cup more broth or water, and return to pressure cook for the remaining time. Repeat if needed."
