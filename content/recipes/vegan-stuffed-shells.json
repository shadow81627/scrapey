      "text": "Add all vegan ricotta ingredients to a food processor and blend until smooth, 1-2 minutes. If it seems really thick you can always add in a tablespoon or so of almond milk or water. Add the ricotta cheese to a large bowl and mix in the cooked vegetables."

      "text": "Pre-heat oven to 400 degrees F. Pour about 3/4 of the tomato sauce into the bottom of a 9×13 baking dish and spread out. Use a one tablespoon scoop to scoop ricotta cheese into each shell noodle and then place into the baking dish. Spoon a few teaspoons of marinara sauce over each stuffed shell and bake in the oven until sauce is bubbly, about 30 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with vegan parmesan and fresh herbs."
