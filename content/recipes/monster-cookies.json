    "text": "Make ahead: The dough balls can be formed and placed on one baking sheet. Press each dough ball down to flatten to about 2 inches wide and 1/2-inch tall (this will help it spread when baked), then freeze solid unbaked. Transfer to a freezer zip-top bag and freeze for up to 2 months. Bake from frozen, adding a minute or 2 to the bake time.Storage: The cookies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days."
