To roll the wraps, place a lettuce leaf, with the base edge closest to you, on the benchtop (see tip). Place the rice vermicelli neatly on top. Spoon on the spring onion oil in a line about 2cm from the bottom of the leaf, then add a slice each of cucumber and pork belly and 1 prawn. Spoon on the pickled carrot and some of its sauce. Add some mint leaves and bean shoots. Roll up the lettuce tightly to make a log – trim any excess lettuce leaf when you get to the end. Secure with a skewer inserted sideways into the roll. Repeat with the remaining ingredients."
