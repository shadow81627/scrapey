      "text": "Soak the black eyed peas for 2-4 hours. Wash and drain to use. In a pan, add 2 tsps oil and heat on medium heat. Add onions, bay leaf and chili pepper or green pepper. Cook until golden. Add 1/2 cup pasta sauce, herbs, salt, garlic, black pepper, mix well and cook for a minute. Add soaked black eyed peas and water and cover fully and cook on low-medium heat for 30-40 minutes or until tender. (the duration of soaking and old/new batch of peas will determine the cook time. add more water and cook longer if needed). If using cooked/canned peas, add 1/2 cup water and mix and cook for 15-20 minutes until almost dry. Taste and adjust salt and spice. Or you can use any Indian spiced black eyed pea stew from the blog.:) Use less water to make a dryer stew."
