While water is coming to a boil, heat a large pot over medium heat and add olive oil, red pepper, green pepper, onion, salt, pepper and herbs de Provence. Cook vegetables until tender, 3-5 minutes. Next add the garlic and cook for another minute. Using your hands, carefully squeeze the tomatoes into the pot and then add a little bit of the leftover liquid, depending on how thick you want your sauce to be. Bring sauce to a simmer and stir occasionally."
