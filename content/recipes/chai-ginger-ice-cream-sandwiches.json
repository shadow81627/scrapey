Then form into disc shapes by scooping 1/4 cup amounts into the lid of a peanut butter jar or similar-shaped object, lined with plastic wrap. Fold the plastic wrap to completely cover the ice cream, remove from lid and shape into a loose disc. Pop in the freezer to re-harden. Alternatively, if you don't care about the shape, just smash a big scoop between the cookies."
