You can pick up the strainer and rock it from side to side to encourage more juice to come out but you don’t want to use a spoon to press down everything in the strainer. If you do that it will allow some of the pulp to get through and you don’t want that. Once it’s just pulp left in the strainer you can dump that out and strain the rest of the juice."
