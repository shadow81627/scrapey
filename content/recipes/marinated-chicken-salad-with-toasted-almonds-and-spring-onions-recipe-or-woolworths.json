Tip 1: If you have time roast 2 x 1.5kg fresh chickens. They will take about 1 hour on 180Â°C fan forced. Tip 2: You can marinade the chicken in the vinaigrette 24 hours before serving. But its best to remove it from the fridge 15-30 minutes before serving to allow it to come to room temperature. Tip 3: You can replace the homemade dressing with 1 cup of your favourite purchased dressing. Note: Remove the crusts from day-old white bread slices and cut into cubes. Transfer the cubes to the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped"
