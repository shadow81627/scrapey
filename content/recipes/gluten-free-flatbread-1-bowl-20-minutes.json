    "1 cup light coconut milk (canned), plus more as needed",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil (if oil-free, omit or try subbing tahini)",
    "1 tsp apple cider vinegar",
    "2 tsp baking powder",
    "1/2 heaping tsp sea salt",
    "3/4 tsp garlic powder",
    "3/4 tsp dried oregano",
    "1/2 cup coconut flour*",
    "3/4 cup oat flour* (ground from gluten-free oats)",
    "3/4 cup potato starch (NOT flour // potato starch is pretty key here for fluffy texture, so we recommend against subbing it out)",

      "text": "At this point you should have a dough that is malleable and very slightly tacky but doesn’t stick to your hands. The dough should start pulling away from the sides of the bowl when the right amount of moisture is achieved, and it shouldn’t be crumbly at all. Add a bit more of each flour until you reach the right consistency."

      "text": "Scoop out 1 ball of dough (~3 Tbsp in size) and place between two pieces of parchment paper. Use a rolling pin to roll into a thin oval shape slightly larger than 1/8-inch thick. For fluffier, thicker flatbread roll to slightly less than 1/4-inch thick and cook slightly longer. NOTE: If sticking or too tacky, add a light dusting of GF flour to the dough while rolling out (optional - shouldn't be necessary)."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat a skillet (cast iron is best, or non-stick) over medium/medium-high heat. Once hot, spray or drizzle with a little oil. Then use hands to carefully transfer the dough to the pan. If it cracks at all, just carefully and quickly patch back together with your hands (be careful not to touch the hot skillet)."

      "text": "Cook for 2-3 minutes or until the underside is golden brown. Bubbles may form while it’s cooking — that’s normal and good. Flip carefully and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Lower heat as needed to ensure it doesn’t burn. You’ll know it’s done when both sides are golden brown."

      "text": "Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator or at room temperature for up to 2-3 days. To freeze, place cooked, cooled flatbread in a freezer-safe container or bag (adding parchment paper between each flatbread will prevent sticking) and freeze for up to 1 month. As with most bread, best when fresh."
