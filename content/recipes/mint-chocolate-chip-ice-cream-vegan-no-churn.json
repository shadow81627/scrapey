    "1 (13.5-oz.) can full-fat coconut milk (use a smooth, creamy brand // we used Field Day)",
    "2 Tbsp cashew butter",
    "10-12 fresh mint leaves",
    "1/4 tsp peppermint extract",
    "1/4 cup maple syrup",
    "1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1/4-1/2 tsp matcha powder (optional // for green color)",
    "1 pinch sea salt (optional)",
    "2-6 Tbsp unsweetened almond milk (or other dairy-free milk)",
    "1/3 - 1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (ensure vegan/dairy-free as needed // we used Enjoy Life)"

Transfer the mixture to an ice cube tray — it should make ~14-16 standard-size ice cubes. Freeze for at least 6 hours."

      "text": "SOFT SERVE: To a food processor (our preferred method) or high-speed blender, add all of the coconut milk ice cubes, along with 2 Tbsp (30 ml) of almond milk. Pulse or blend until all of the ice cubes have completely broken down and you have a thick, smooth consistency. You may need to stop and stir a few times to get it moving, or add more almond milk 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time until it mixes more easily. If using a blender, use the blender’s tamper, pressing down to help it mix."
