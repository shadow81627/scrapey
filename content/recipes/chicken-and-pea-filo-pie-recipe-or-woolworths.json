      "text": "Toss together the leftover chicken, potatoes, peas, and curry powder, and season well with salt and black pepper. Carefully pour over a little of the stock. Use just enough to wet the mixture and produce a little gravy, but don’t add too much because it will soak the pastry."

      "text": "Spoon the chicken filling into the filo pastry shell. Fold the pastry edges in towards the middle, and top the pie with the remaining 6 filo sheets, each brushed with a little melted butter. Tuck the edges of the pastry neatly down at the sides, and make sure that the top is well glazed with melted butter. Bake in the oven for 20-30 minutes until the pastry is cooked and golden. Serve hot."
