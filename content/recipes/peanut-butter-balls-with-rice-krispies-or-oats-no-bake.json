    "description": "Peanut butter balls with Rice Krispies or Oats. No Bake, 6 Ingredient.\nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE : https://www.veganricha.com/2018/08/peanut-butter-balls-with-rice-krispies.html\nðŸ’™ mY BOOKS: https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nThese Nut Butter Cookie Bites are like no bake chocolate peanut butter Cookies. 6 Ingredients. Rice Krispies add texture to these Nut Butter Energy Bites. Use Oats or puffed quinoa, millet, other grain. Vegan Gluten-free Soy-free Recipe. Use sunbutter for nutfree.\n\nI was thinking of making a version oat nut butter no bake cookies at first. I donâ€™t particularly like oats raw (although you can sub them here easily), so I changed them up. I like texture much better from rice krispies. They add crunch and airyness to an otherwise dense bite. Use any grain krispies/puffed grain such as quinoa, millet, wheat, plain or chocolate.  These bites have texture from the krispies and chocolate, fudgy from peanut butter, amazing flavor and are super quick to make. Just add into the processor, process, shape, chill. These bites keep well for a couple of weeks (they never last that long!). \n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegan #veganism #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic: Island by Lakey Inspired\nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/",
