  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 Tbsp flaxseed meal",
    "5 Tbsp water (to make flax eggs*)",
    "3/4 cup plain unsweetened dairy-free milk (we used almond)",
    "1 Tbsp lemon juice",
    "1/3 cup organic cane sugar (or sub coconut sugar, but the muffins will be darker and taste more wholesome)",
    "1/4 cup melted vegan butter (we like Miyoko’s or Earth Balance)",
    "1 1/2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "2 1/4 cups almond flour",
    "3/4 cup potato starch (NOT potato flour)",
    "1/3 cup brown rice flour",
    "2 tsp baking powder",
    "1/2 tsp baking soda",
    "3/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 1/4 cups fresh blueberries (DIVIDED)"

      "text": "Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a standard muffin tin with paper baking cups. (We find the unbleached, brown paper liners work best — they don’t stick to the muffins when peeled away)."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "In a medium mixing bowl, prepare the flax eggs by combining flaxseed meal and water, and set aside to gel for 5 minutes. Measure out your dairy-free milk, and add the lemon juice to it. Gently stir and set aside to curdle."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add the sugar to the flax eggs and use a hand mixer to beat briefly to combine. Then add the melted butter and vanilla and mix again. Add the milk/lemon mixture and mix once more to combine."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add the almond flour to the liquid ingredients and mix again using the hand mixer, then add all remaining ingredients except the blueberries, and mix one final time. The mixture should be thick yet fluffy. Before adding the blueberries, place a small amount of plain batter in the bottom of each muffin tin (~2 tsp) and spread it out. This will help prevent the blueberries from sinking to the bottom and making your muffins soggy!"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once all your muffin tins have batter on the bottom, add 1 cup (160 g) of the blueberries to the remaining batter, setting 1/4 cup (40 g) of blueberries aside for the tops of the muffins. Gently fold and mix the batter to evenly distribute the blueberries."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Evenly divide the remaining batter between the muffin tins, and then top the muffins with the remaining 1/4 cup (40 g) of blueberries, pressing them into the top of each muffin so they don’t stick out. Optionally, sprinkle the tops of the muffins with cane or turbinado sugar for a sweet and sparkly topping!"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Bake for 28-35 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, or with very few crumbs, and the tops are lightly golden brown. Remove from oven and let cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Then remove from the tin and let cool completely on a cooling rack. The wrappers peel away more easily and the muffin texture is best when completely cooled."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once cooled, muffins will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 1-2 days, in the refrigerator for 4-5 days, or in the freezer for 1 month."
