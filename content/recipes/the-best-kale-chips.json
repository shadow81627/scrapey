      "text": "Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Rinse kale and using your hands, or a knife, remove the kale leaves from the stem. Tear the leave into bite size pieces and place on a baking sheet. You want to lay out the kale leaves so that they aren’t overlapped so they have room to crisp up. Parchment paper will make them easier to flip, but I usually forget to use it and they turn out fine."
