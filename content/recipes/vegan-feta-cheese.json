    "350 g / 12 oz extra firm tofu (, no need to press)",

    "45 ml / 3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lemon juice",
    "30 ml / 2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar",
    "1 tablespoon nutritional yeast",
    "1 teaspoon onion powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "1/4 teaspoon dried dill (leaves not seeds)",

      "text": "Add all of the ingredients to a food processor (this recipe does not work well in a blender, even a high powered one), starting off with only half of the salt. Blend it all up until smooth then taste and add more salt as needed. Blend to incorporate it after each addition. Remember that this is feta so it should have quite a salty edge. I like to use a full 2 teaspoons in mine."
