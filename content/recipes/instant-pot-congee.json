  "headline": "Instant Pot Congee",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Substitutions:Protein: Substitute your choice of protein, raw or cooked, for the cooked chicken. If using raw protein (such as ground pork or beef, chicken, shrimp, or fish), slice thinly if needed and season with salt before adding. Stir in immediately once the pressure has released. The heat from the congee should cook the protein quickly. If using larger pieces of protein, hit “Sauté” and bring the congee back to a boil, stirring often, until the protein is fully cooked.  Vegetables: Substitute your choice of vegetables for the corn. Firm, uncooked vegetables (such as carrots or sliced shiitake mushrooms) can be added before the cooking process. Tender vegetables (such as spinach or shredded lettuce) can be stirred in after the pressure has released.Vegetarian / vegan congee: To make vegetarian/vegan congee, use vegetable stock or water for the cooking liquid. Replace the shredded chicken with a block of firm tofu, sliced. A handful of dried shiitake mushrooms, dried shrimp, and/or dried scallops can all add rich umami flavor to congee. Soak these ingredients in hot water for about an hour, then slice or coarsely chop. Add to the Instant Pot with the rice before cooking.Storage: Refrigerate leftover congee in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Congee will thicken as it sits; add a bit more water or stock when reheating to restore to original consistency."
