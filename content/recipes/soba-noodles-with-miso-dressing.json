  "description": "A Â fabulous Asian-inspired soba noodle salad with a tasty ginger miso salad dressing. We added carrots and cucumbers and shelled edamame for plant-based protein. Make a big batch and you'll have a great pack and go lunch for a few days. Also great as a light dinner or even a healthy snack :)",
