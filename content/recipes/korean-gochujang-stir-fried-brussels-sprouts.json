    "1/2 cup Korean Gochujang Sauce (or store-bought - just ensure it’s vegan/gluten-free)",
    "1 Tbsp sesame oil (sub water if avoiding oil // plus more for sautéing)",
    "1/3 cup coconut aminos (or sub tamari, but reduce amount slightly as it’s saltier)",
    "2-3 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "1 Pinch sea salt",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp chili garlic sauce (for more heat // I like Huy Fong Foods brand)",
    "1 Tbsp sesame oil or avocado oil (sub water if avoiding oil // plus more for sautéing)",
    "7 heaped cups halved Brussels sprouts (as consistent in size as possible)",
    "3 Tbsp coconut aminos (or sub tamari, but reduce amount slightly as it’s saltier)",

These are delicious on their own but would also pair well with our Gochujang Cauliflower, Easy Vegan Kimchi, Quinoa Fried Rice, Sesame Eggplant and Almond Butter Tofu Bowls."
