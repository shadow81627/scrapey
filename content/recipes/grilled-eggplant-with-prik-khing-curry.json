If using a gas grill, heat one half of the grill to medium-high and the other to medium. Heat 1/2 cup coconut oil in a small heatproof saucepan on the medium heat zone. (Alternatively, heat on the stovetop over medium heat,) Add 2 tablespoons curry paste and whisk until fragrant and the color deepens slightly, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat."

Brush the curry oil onto one side of the eggplant. Working in batches if needed, place the planks curry-side down on the grill grates. Brush the second side with curry oil. Grill uncovered until starting to char on the bottom, about 2 minutes. Flip the planks and grill until the eggplant is tender, about 2 minutes more, brushing more curry oil, if desired. Carefully transfer the eggplant to a serving platter. Taste and season with salt as needed."
