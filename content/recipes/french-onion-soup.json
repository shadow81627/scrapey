    "2 Tbsp olive oil ($0.32)",

    "6 cups beef broth* ($0.78)",
    "1/2 tsp dried thyme ($0.05)",

      "text": "Continue to cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally until the onions are deeply caramelized (the color of an old penny). This should take about an hour total. If needed, add a couple tablespoons of water to dissolve any browned bits off the bottom to prevent them from burning while the onions continue to cook."

Place one piece of toasted bread with melted cheese on top of each bowl of soup just before serving."
