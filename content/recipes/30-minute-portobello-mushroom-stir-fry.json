    "2 cloves garlic (minced // 2 cloves yield ~1 Tbsp)",
    "2 tsp minced ginger",
    "3-4 Tbsp maple syrup (or agave nectar or coconut sugar)",
    "1/2 tsp red pepper flake (more or less to taste)",

    "1 Tbsp sesame oil (toasted or untoasted)",
    "3 Tbsp lime juice",
    "1 Tbsp water",
    "2 portobello mushrooms (~20 g each)",
    "1 medium red bell pepper (thinly sliced)",

You may have to do this in two batches depending on the size of your pan."
