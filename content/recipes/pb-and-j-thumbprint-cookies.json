    "1/2 cup smooth peanut butter ( use almond butter or cashew butter for peanut free) see notes for nutfree)",
    "1/3 cup maple syrup",
    "2 tbsp warmed non dairy milk (such as almond, soy, oat or coconut)",
    "1/2 tsp vanilla extract (optional)",
    "3/4 to 1 cup flour (I use a mix of 3/4 all purpose and 1/4 wheat. Use oat flour or gf blend for glutenfree)",
    "1/4 tsp baking soda",
    "1/3 tsp salt",
    "3-4 tbsp fruit preserves (Raspberry, strawberry, cherry etc as needed)"

      "text": "Mix flour, baking soda, and salt in another bowl, then add 3/4 cup of the dry mix to the wet and make a soft sticky dough. Depending on your peanut butter and flour you might need to add a bit more flour. The dough will be soft but shouldn’t be too runny/sticky. It will get more handleable on chilling. Refrigerate the cookie dough for 15 mins. If still too sticky then add more flour."
