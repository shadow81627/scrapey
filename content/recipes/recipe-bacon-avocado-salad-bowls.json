Once everything is nicely coated, taste to make sure you have enough salt. If the salad doesn’t pop, add a good pinch. Add the avocado and cilantro and toss just once or twice to keep the avocado pretty and the cilantro from getting caught in a salad dressing vortex. Divide the salad among 4 bowls and top each with a fried egg."
