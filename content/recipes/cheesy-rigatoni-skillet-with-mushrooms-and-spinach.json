Add the olive oil and minced garlic to a large skillet and sauté for about one minute over medium heat, or just until the garlic becomes fragrant.

If you want the cheese to brown a bit, place it under your oven's broiler (without a lid) and watch closely until it develops a few browned spots. Serve hot."
