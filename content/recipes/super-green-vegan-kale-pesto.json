    "description": "Easy vegan pesto with tons of fresh herbs, nutrient-rich kale, seeds, and nutritional yeast! The perfect 10-minute spread or sauce for Italian night and beyond! Vegan, gluten-free, and oil-free optional.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/super-green-vegan-kale-pesto/\n\nPesto is a sauce that is believed to have originated in the Liguria region of northwestern Italy. It’s thought that it may have evolved from a 13th century garlic-based sauce called aggiadda or from the tradition of using aromatic herbs in the Middle Ages.\n\nThe first written recipe for pesto was from Giovanni Battista Ratto in his 19th century work The Genoese cuisine. This recipe was a mix of garlic, basil, and cheese. Our plant-based version is not traditional, but uses basil and garlic and has a similar flavor. We add kale and parsley for a diversity of greens and nutrients.\n\nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
