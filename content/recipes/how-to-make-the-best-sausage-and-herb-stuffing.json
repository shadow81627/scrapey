    "text": "Make ahead: The stuffing can be prepared up to 2 days in advance. Transfer the stuffing to the baking dish and let cool to room temperature. Cover with aluminum foil and refrigerate up to 2 days. When ready to bake, remove the stuffing from the refrigerator while the oven heats, about 20 minutes. Bake covered for 30 minutes, then uncover and bake until browned and heated through, about 15 minutes more. Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days.Stale bread variation: Instead of baking the bread, let the torn bread sit uncovered on a baking sheet at room temperature until dry, 1 to 2 days.

    "description": "A browned and burnished turkey may be the centerpiece of the Thanksgiving table, but the true star of the meal sits over to the side. Thanksgiving stuffing is the dish I look forward to all year long. Every year I promise myself I won't wait until the holidays to serve a herby, custardy, and crouton-crisped bread pudding. This year I'm making a stuffing with toasty torn sourdough bread, browned sausage, crisp apples, and an abundance of fresh sage, thyme, and parsley. And since this stuffing doesn't require being actually \"stuffed\" in the turkey, there's no reason not to enjoy this holiday dressing throughout the fall and winter. \n\nCheck out the full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/sausage-stuffing-recipe-23087478)",
