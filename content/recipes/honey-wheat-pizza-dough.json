      "text": "To shape the dough, remove it from the bowl it was rising in and place it on a floured surface. Press the dough down into a large circle. This should be fairly easy since it was pretty circular in shape as it rose. Next, pick the dough up with your hands and transfer it to a pizza pan (coated in non-stick spray or sprinkled with corn meal). Press the dough out even further until it reaches the edges of the pan. Alternatively, you can pick the dough up and stretch it with your fists (this can take practice)."
