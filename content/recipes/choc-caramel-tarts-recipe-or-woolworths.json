Spoon chocolate over caramel and sprinkle with almonds. Stand to set. Serve. Tip 1: You can prepare and bake the tart shells to the end of step 2, then store for up to two weeks in an airtight container. Prepare filling one week ahead and store in fridge. Assemble tarts just before serving. Tip 2: Melt chocolate over boiling simmering water, keep stirring. Note: Vanilla extract is different to vanilla essence."
