    "1 tsp avocado or olive oil (if oil-free, omit oil and rub with a little maple syrup)",
    "1 healthy pinch each sea salt and black pepper",
    "1 Tbsp avocado oil (or sub other neutral oil or vegan butter // if oil-free, sub water and add more as needed to prevent sticking)",
    "1 cup diced red onion (or sub white or yellow)",
    "1 medium red or orange bell pepper, diced",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 (15-oz) can black beans, drained and rinsed",
    "1 1/2 cups red enchilada sauce (or store-bought such as Frontera brand)",
    "1/2 cup crushed tortilla chips (grain-free as needed)",
