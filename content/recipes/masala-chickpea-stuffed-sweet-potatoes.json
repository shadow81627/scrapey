    "description": "Perfectly baked, stuffed sweet potatoes topped with tandoori masala spiced chickpeas and green chutney. Just 10 ingredients required!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/masala-chickpea-stuffed-sweet-potatoes/\n\nThis recipe is not a Traditional Indian dish, but rather, Indian-inspired. We were inspired by the flavors of Tandoori Masala spice blend and by our Mediterranean Baked Sweet Potatoes recipe, which takes inspiration from Mediterranean flavors. \n\nTandoori Masala spices typically include cumin, red chili, fenugreek, black pepper, cardamom, cinnamon, clove, cardamom, nutmeg, turmeric, and ginger (among others). It’s spicy, robust, yet balanced and incredibly versatile. And we especially love it on roasted chickpeas.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
