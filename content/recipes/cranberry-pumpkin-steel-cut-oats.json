      "text": "To a medium saucepan, add water and almond milk and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add oats and pumpkin purée and stir. Lower heat to a simmer, cover, and let cook for about 15-20 minutes, depending on how soft you prefer your oats (I like mine with a little bite so tend to cook them less)."

      "text": "Add cranberries to the oven and bake for about 15-20 minutes total, or until burst and tender. Once cooked, stir with a spoon and taste to see if it needs any more sweetness (I added a bit of stevia extract)."

      "text": "Once the oats have finished cooking, remove from heat and add coconut sugar, cinnamon, pumpkin pie spice, ground ginger, and flaxseed meal (optional). Stir to combine, adding a little more almond milk if too thick. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more coconut sugar (or stevia) for sweetness, or spices for warmth."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "To serve, divide oats and cranberries between two serving bowls. Enjoy as is or add a spoonful of coconut cream (or coconut whipped cream) and toasted pecans. Best when fresh, though leftovers keep in the refrigerator for a few days. Reheat on the stovetop (or the microwave), adding more almond milk or water as they tend to dry out once refrigerated."
