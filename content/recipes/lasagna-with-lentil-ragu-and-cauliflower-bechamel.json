Water-fry them with 2 tablespoons of stock or water until the vegetables are soft and translucent, 8 to 10 minutes. Then stir in the garlic and chile and cook for 2 minutes more. Add the tomato puree, mushroom powder, maple syrup, lentils, oregano, basil, stock, and salt to taste. Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to low and simmer for 15 to 20 minutes."

Drain the florets and transfer them to a blender. Add the cashews, stock, nutritional yeast, salt, and nutmeg. Blend until completely smooth. Set aside."

      "text": "When the ragù is ready, assemble the lasagna. Spread a little ragù over the bottom of a large (mine is 8 x 12 inches), high-sided baking dish. Top with a layer of lasagna noodles, then a layer of ragù. Continue to layer the lasagna noodles and ragù until the baking dish is almost full and you have used up all the ragù. Top the lasagna with the béchamel and transfer the dish to the middle rack of your oven. Bake for 45 minutes, then remove from the oven. Let it cool for 10 minutes before serving."
