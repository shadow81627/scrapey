Meanwhile, put the oil for frying in a deep-sided frying pan and set over a high heat until it reaches 200°C. To test, pop a small cube of bread in the fat. If it sizzles, the fat is ready to use."

Cook, turning occasionally, for 2-3 minutes, or until the fish pieces are a rich golden brown. Make sure they don't stick together. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on sheets of kitchen paper to remove any excess fat. Sprinkle with a little salt and serve hot with the lemon mayonnaise."
