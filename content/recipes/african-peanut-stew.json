Once hot, add the onions and sauté for about 5 minutes – until they are translucent and fragrant. Add the garlic and ginger and sauté for an additional 60 seconds. While the onions cook, dice your potatoes. Note: Feel free to leave the skin on the potatoes for extra nutrition. If you do keep the skins on, simply scrub them under warm water to clean them first."
