Rub the fruit and veggies with a thin coating of olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt. Grill the onions until browned, about 3 minutes; set aside. Grill the peaches on each side for about 2 minutes, until the outside is hot and slightly charred; set aside. Grill the ears of corn until the kernels are lightly charred, turning the cobs occasionally, 3 to 4 minutes. Cool the vegetables and fruit just enough to be handled safely, then dice into bite-sized pieces. Use a knife with a thin blade to slice the corn kernels off the cobs."
