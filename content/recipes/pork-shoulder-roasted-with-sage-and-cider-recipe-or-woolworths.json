Tie the pork with cooking twine to help it keep its shape while cooking. Place the pork in a roasting pan and pour 2 tbs olive oil over the skin and rub in evenly. Sprinkle with salt and roast for 30 minutes or until skin starts to crackle. Reduce oven temperature to 160oC, then add cider and stock to the base of the roasting pan and roast for a further 1 1/2 hours."
