  "recipeIngredient": [
    "8 ounces tempeh (we like Tofurky brand // ensure gluten-free friendly if needed // ensure grain-free if needed // opt for soy-free if needed)",
    "2 tsp chili garlic sauce (or bird's-eye chilies or red pepper flake to taste)",
    "1 Tbsp sesame oil (if avoiding oil, omit and add a bit more lime, coconut aminos, + maple syrup)",
    "2 Tbsp salted creamy peanut butter (or almond, cashew, or sunflower butter)",
    "6 Tbsp coconut aminos (or sub gluten-free tamari* (which contains soy)",
    "3 Tbsp lime juice",
    "2 Tbsp maple syrup (plus more to taste)",
    "2 tsp fresh turmeric* (optional) )",
    "4 cloves garlic (peeled)",
    "1 Pinch sea salt",
    "1 stalk lemongrass (ends removed, chopped into thirds)",
    "Fresh cilantro",
    "Peanut Sauce",
    "Butter lettuce cups or salads",
    "Noodle Bowls",
    "Sriracha or chili garlic sauce"

    {

      "text": "Rinse, pat dry, and cut into bite-size pieces. I prefer slicing the tempeh in half lengthwise then cutting into triangles or rectangles. Keep in mind they need to be thick and large enough to add to skewers (if using). Set aside."

      "text": "Add the sliced tempeh to the marinade and toss to coat. Then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably 24 hours. I found that 24 hours infused the most flavor! While marinating, toss/stir occasionally to ensure even coating. It's best if the tempeh is marinated in a bag or a shallow dish to ensure all pieces are submerged in the marinade."

      "text": "Once marinated, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a baking mat. Carefully add tempeh to grill/oven-safe skewers and arrange on your baking sheet. Reserve any leftover marinade to brush/serve with the tempeh once baked. (If skipping skewers, proceed to step 8 by placing tempeh directly on baking sheet unskewered.)"
