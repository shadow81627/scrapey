  "description": "Moist &amp; flavourful Sticky Banana Date Pudding with a spoon-licking, boozy, rum caramel sauce. Rich, delicious &amp; truly indulgent!&nbsp;Made individually, these little puddings are baked in the oven &amp; are no more difficult to make than muffins. Plus they can be made in advance &amp; freeze perfectly. Great for making ahead!",

    "2 medium bananas (, mashed with a fork)",
    "4 tablespoons coconut oil (measured after melting)",
    "1 tablespoon unsulphured or blackstrap molasses (I like the one from Wholesome Sweeteners)",
    "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
    "250mls / 1 cup plus 2 teaspoons unsweetened non-dairy milk",
    "75g / 1/2 cup g coconut sugar (, (any granulated sugar will work as a sub but it's a bit heavier so half a cup will be about 100g)",
    "1 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "270g / 2 cups spelt flour (I have not tested these puddings with any other flour)",
    "2 teaspoons baking powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon baking soda",
    "10 medjool dates (, stoned and chopped finely, (dried dates can be subbed but soak them in hot water for 15 mins first)",
    "60g / 1/2 cup chopped walnuts (optional)",
    "150g / 1 cup coconut sugar",
    "10 tablespoons of rum",
    "6 tablespoons cashew butter (almond butter would probably work too)",
    "4 to 8 tablespoons water",
    "More walnuts for sprinkling (optional)"
