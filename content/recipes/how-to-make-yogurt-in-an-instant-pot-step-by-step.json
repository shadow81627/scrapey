    "8 cups milk, preferably whole (but any kind will work)",
    "2 tablespoons yogurt, labeled “contains live cultures” (not just made with)",

Since we’re going to be growing a culture in it, it is super important that a 6 or 8-quart Instant Pot's stainless steel, lid, and sealing ring are nice and clean. Hot soapy water and a hot rinse before drying with a clean kitchen towel should do the trick."

Press the yogurt button until it says boil. For most Instant Pots, you’ll just need to hit the yogurt button once or twice and then press start. The Instant Pot will use the heating element to bring the milk mixture close to a boil. After 25 to 35 minutes (depending on your model), the Instant Pot will beep indicating the boiling cycle has finished. Stay close as your model make take more or less time to come to temperature."

If you’ve got 180°F, remove the insert and let cool at room temperature for about an hour. Alternatively, you can cool the mixture by filling your sink with ice water and gentle submerging the bottom of the insert in the ice water — this will take about 10 minutes. Your goal temperature for cooling is 110°F."

Return the insert to the Instant Pot (make sure the bottom is dry if you used the water cooling method). With a clean ladle, ladle off about a cup of the warm milk into a small bowl or measuring cup with a spout. Add the yogurt and whisk to combine. Return the yogurt mixture to the Instant Pot and whisk gently to combine. If you’re sweetening or flavoring your yogurt, this is also the time to add those optional ingredients."

This will begin a count up clock on the incubation period. After about 3 hours the yogurt will begin to thicken. Start checking the thickness and flavor at about 6 hours by gently dipping a spoon into the yogurt. Avoid mixing the yogurt while it cooks, or you’ll have very loose yogurt. 8 hours of cooking will yield perfectly thickened and delightfully tangy yogurt — about what you’d expect from typical whole-milk yogurt. You can continue to cook the yogurt for 2 hours more for thicker, tangier yogurt."

Refrigerate until chilled through, at least 4 hours or overnight, the yogurt will thicken slightly more when chilled. Transfer to airtight containers for long-term airtight storage. Remember to save some of this yogurt if you plan on making more yogurt in the near future."
