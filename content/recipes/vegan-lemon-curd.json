    "1 cup (240 mls) lemon juice (, freshly squeezed not from a bottle (roughly about 5 or 6 lemons)",
    "1 cup (240 mls) light canned coconut milk (, not full fat)",
    "1/2 cup (120 mls) water",

      "text": "Place the pan over a medium low heat and whisk or stir constantly (don't stop as otherwise lumps will form) until it starts to thicken. Once it gets hot and thickens, use the metal spoon to test it. Dip the spoon in then lift it out, and once the curd can easily coat the back of the spoon and not just run off it is done. Turn off the heat as soon as it reaches that stage otherwise it will end up too thick."
