Pulse a few times to mix and break up the chickpeas and artichokes. Don't over mix, you want there to be texture still. If the mixture has reached the correct texture but the ingredients aren't mixed well, use a spoon or spatula to finish mixing. Divide the mixture into 6 and use your hands to form 6 patties."
