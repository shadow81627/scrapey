    "2lb / 32 oz / 907 g fresh California Strawberries",
    "1 small lime",

Or after brushing pick the tortilla up and dip it into the bowl of cinnamon sugar. Do it whichever way works best for you. Dipping makes the sugar coating more even, but sprinkling is quicker!"

      "text": "Wash and chop the mint (leaves only) and add it to the chopped strawberries along with the jam, juice from the lime and vanilla. Stir it all up well then add the freshly ground black pepper. It's better to start with just a little pepper as you can always add more but you can't take it away. I suggest adding it to taste. Give it a good but gentle stir in between additions."
