      "text": "Combine mince and onion mixture in a bowl. Cut the pastry sheets in half. Divide the filling into eight portions. Place each portion on one long side of each pastry piece and form into a sausage shape. Brush the other long side with a little egg. Roll up to enclose. Cut each roll into four pieces and place onto trays, seam-side down. Brush tops lightly with egg and cut slits in the top. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Note: The addition of cherry is a great twist on a classic snack. You could use chicken, pork or veal mince for these sausage rolls, or even a combination."
