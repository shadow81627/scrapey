Place each portion on one long side of each pastry piece and form into a sausage shape. Brush the other long side with a little egg. Roll up to enclose. Cut each roll into four pieces and place onto trays, seamside down. Brush tops lightly with egg and cut slits in the top. Sprinkle with poppy seeds. Bake for 20-25 minutes or until golden. Note: The addition of cherry is a great twist on a classic snack. You could use chicken, pork or veal mince for these sausage rolls, or even a combination."
