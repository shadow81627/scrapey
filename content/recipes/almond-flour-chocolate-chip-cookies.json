    "2 cups / 192 g almond flour",
    "1/2 cup / 100 g cane sugar or granulated white sugar (, see notes for sugar-free alternative)",
    "1/2 teaspoon baking powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon fine salt",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 cup / 87 g dairy-free chocolate chips (, plus a few more for decorating the tops)",
