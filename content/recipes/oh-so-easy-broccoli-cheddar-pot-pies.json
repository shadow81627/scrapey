      "text": "Combine milk and flour in a large saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, whisking constantly. Reduce heat to low and simmer 3-5 minutes, until mixture is thick, continuing to whisk. Remove from heat and whisk in cheese about 1/4 cup at a time. Season with salt and pepper or cayenne. Yes, it's really thick right now, but don't panic! Adding the broccoli and baking will thin the sauce significantly, so err on the salty side--I used 1/2 teaspoon. Fold in broccoli florets."
