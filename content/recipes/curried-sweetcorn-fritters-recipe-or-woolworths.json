      "text": "To cook the fritters, heat 1 / 2 -1 tablespoon of vegetable oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium heat. Carefully drop in a large tablespoon of the batter. Cook two fritters at a time if the pan is big enough, but do not overcrowd. Shallow-fry for about 2 minutes until the bottom is golden and crisp. Flip over using a spatula or egg slice, and cook on the other side for another 2 minutes. You will need to stir the batter each time before using, and add more oil to the pan as you go."
