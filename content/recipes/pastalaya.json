    "1 Tbsp vegetable oil ($0.04)",
    "1/2 lb smoked sausage (preferably Andouille) ($2.50)",
    "2 cloves garlic ($0.16)",
    "10 oz bag frozen \"seasoning mix\"* ($1.29)",
    "15 oz can diced tomatoes ($0.59)",
    "1/2 Tbsp Creole seasoning** ($0.15)",
    "1/2 tsp oregano ($0.05)",
    "1/2 tsp smoked paprika ($0.05)",
    "1/4 tsp thyme ($0.02)",
    "Freshly cracked pepper ($0.03)",
    "2 cups chicken broth ($0.26)",
    "1 cup water ($0.00)",
    "1 lb penne pasta ($1.39)",

Add the bag of frozen seasoning mix and sauté until heated through (3-5 minutes). Add the can of diced tomatoes (with juices), Creole seasoning, oregano, smoked paprika, thyme, freshly cracked pepper (about 20 cranks of a pepper mill), and pasta to the pot. Finally, add the chicken broth and 1 cup of water, and stir until everything is evenly combined."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Place a lid on the pot and turn the heat up to medium-high. Let the pot come to a boil. As soon as it reaches a boil, stir briefly, replace the lid, turn the heat down to low, and let the pot simmer for 10-12 minutes, or until the pasta is tender. Stir the pot once every few minutes as it simmers to prevent the pasta from sticking. Replace the lid as quickly as possible to maintain a simmer. If the mixture still seems soupy at around 8 minutes, let the pot simmer without a lid for the last few minutes. A little bit of thick sauce at the bottom of the pot is perfect."
