    "1 large head cauliflower (rinsed, green leaves peeled)",
    "1 Tbsp coconut or olive oil (if oil-free, sub water or maple syrup)",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "2 tsp maple syrup (if avoiding sugar, omit)",
    "2 1/2 tsp shawarma spice blend",
    "1 bunch fresh cilantro (~3 ounces as original recipe is written // stems mostly removed)",
    "3 cloves garlic (crushed)",
    "~1/4 tsp each Salt + pepper (to taste)",
    "1 large lime, juiced (~3 Tbsp or 45 ml as original recipe is written // or sub lemon)",
    "1 Tbsp sweetener (such as maple syrup // plus more to taste)",
    "1-2 Tbsp water (to thin)",
    "1/2 medium avocado (optional // for extra creaminess)"

      "text": "Place on a bare or parchment-lined baking sheet and rub the \"steaks\" with oil (or water), sea salt, maple syrup, and shawarma spice blend to evenly coat. Be gentle, as the cauliflower steaks can break apart, which is no big deal (but it's ideal if they remain in one solid piece)."
