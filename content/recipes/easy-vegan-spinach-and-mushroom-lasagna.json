    "10 ounces frozen chopped spinach (thawed and drained)",
    "1 pound firm or extra-firm tofu (not silken!)",
    "1 teaspoon salt (optional)",
    "2 tablespoons nutritional yeast (adds a cheesy taste)",

Spread half of the tofu mixture on the noodles (you can drop it by spoonfuls and then spread it or hold each noodle in the palm of your hand and spread the tofu on it before placing it in the pan). Cover with another layer of 3 noodles and then spread the remaining tofu mixture over them. Top with a final layer of noodles, and pour the remaining sauce over this."
