    "1 1/2 large white or Spanish onions",
    "3 large cloves garlic",
    "2 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided",

    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, plus more as needed",
    "1/4 teaspoon freshly ground white pepper plus more as needed",
    "1/3 cup dry white wine",
    "2 sprigs fresh parsley",
    "1 sprig fresh rosemary",
    "6 cups salted chicken broth or water",
    "2 large or 4 regular-sized chicken bouillon cubes, if you’re using water (optional)",
    "6 medium white button mushrooms",
    "2 medium scallions (optional)",

Add the onions and garlic, season with 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon white pepper, and cook, stirring often, until softened, about 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms and the remaining 1 tablespoon unsalted butter, increase the heat to medium, and cook, continuing to stir, until the mushrooms release their liquid, 3 to 5 minutes. Increase the heat to high and cook until almost all of the liquid evaporates, 6 to 8 minutes more."

Add 2 fresh parsley sprigs, 1 fresh rosemary sprig, and 6 cups chicken broth or water (with the bouillon cubes, if you’re using them), and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat, cover the pot almost completely, and cook at a gentle simmer for 20 minutes."

Blend the soup directly in the pot with an immersion blender until very smooth. Alternatively, blend in small batches in a stand blender or food processor. If you’re using a processor or an immersion blender, you probably won’t get a super-smooth soup. If you’d like, you can strain the puréed soup through a fine-mesh strainer, but it’s really not necessary."
