And then place the pudding back in the fridge for another hour or so, by which time the pudding will set more and the frozen berries will be defrosted enough to eat.What berries you use is up to you, mixed berries are a good choice, I used some frozen cherries, mango, raspberry and blackberries from a mixed berry packet too."
