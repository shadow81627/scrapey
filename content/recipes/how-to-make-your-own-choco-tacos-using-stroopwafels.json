Place 1 Stroopwafel in the pan and cook until the caramel filling is just soft and the Stroopwafel can bend easily, 15 to 25 seconds per side (be careful not to overheat the Stroopwafel or it will become brittle once frozen). Working quickly, place the Stroopwafel in between the cups and very gently push the cups toward each other to bend the Stroopwafle into the shape of a taco shell where the sides are parallel to each other. (The edges of the Stroopwafle shouldnâ€™t touch.)"
