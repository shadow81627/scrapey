      "text": "TONIC: To make a serving of miso tonic, add 2 tsp miso paste to a serving bowl and add a bit of the broth. Stir to combine. Then add ~1 cup broth and stir to combine (add more broth for a less potent miso flavor, less broth for a more potent miso flavor). Then add a bit of chopped green onion and serve. Best when fresh but will keep in the refrigerator for 2-3 days. Though not ideal for reheating because the aromatic qualities and nutritional benefits of miso are damaged when boiled."
