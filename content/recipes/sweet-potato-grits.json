Loosely wrap the sweet potato in a paper towel, place on a microwave safe plate, and then microwave for 5 minutes on high. Squeeze the sweet potato to see if it is soft all the way through, and microwave for a few minutes longer if it isn’t. Allow the sweet potato to cool slightly, and then scoop out the cooked flesh."

Once it reaches a rolling boil, pour in the uncooked grits. Stir the mixture until it comes back up to a boil, then reduce the heat to the lowest setting, place a lid on top, and let simmer for ten minutes.)"
