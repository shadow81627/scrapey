  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Storage: Store at room temperature, wrapped in plastic wrap or aluminum foil, for up to 4 days. Wrap tightly wrapped in aluminum foil and freeze for up to 3 months.Making oat flour: You can make your own oat flour by pulsing an equal amount of gluten-free old-fashioned rolled oats in a food processor until ground and flour-like. To make muffins: Line a standard 12-well muffin pan with papers liners or coat the wells with cooking spray. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin wells and bake at 350°F until the muffins are golden-brown and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes."
