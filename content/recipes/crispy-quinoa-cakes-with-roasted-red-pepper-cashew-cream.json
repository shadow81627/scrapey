  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 1/2 cups cooked white quinoa (at room temperature)",
    "4 large eggs (beaten)",
    "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1/4 cup finely chopped fresh basil",
    "1/2 cup finely minced red onion",
    "1/3 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese",
    "3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "1 1/2 cup bread crumbs (since I cook gluten-free, I made my bread crumbs by pulsing an Udi's bagel in the food processor)",
    "Olive oil or clarified butter for coating pan"

      "text": "In a large bowl combine the quinoa, eggs, and salt; stir to mix well. Add the basil, red onion, cheese, garlic, and breadcrumbs to the bowl; stir, then let the mixture sit for a few minutes so that the bread crumbs can absorb some of the moisture. If your mixture is too wet you can add a little more breadcrumbs at this point and if it is too dry add a small amount of water."

      "text": "Heat a tablespoon of olive oil or clarified butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium-low heat. Form the mixture into 12 small patties; when the oil is hot place enough patties in the skillet so that it is full, but the patties still have room in between them. Cover, and cook for 7-10 minutes, until the bottoms are crisp and deeply browned. Carefully flip the patties with a spatula and cook the second side for about 7 minutes more. Remove from the skillet and cool on a wire rack while you cook the remaining patties."
