    "3/4 teaspoon fine sea salt (, not table salt)",
    "1 3/4 cup (210 grams) flour (, spelt, all-purpose flour (plain flour in the UK), wholewheat or gluten-free all-purpose flour blend)",
    "2 teaspoons baking powder",
    "3/4 teaspoon baking soda (, (bicarbonate of soda in the UK)",

Once the 5 minutes has passed, immediately turn the oven down to 350°F (175°C) without peeking or opening the door and cook for a further 16 to 17 minutes. Check them with a toothpick and if it comes out mostly clean (except for some melted chocolate) then they are done. It is important not to over-bake these muffins. If anything they are better very slightly underdone to keep their moist fudginess."
