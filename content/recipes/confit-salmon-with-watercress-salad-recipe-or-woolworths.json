      "text": "Take a roasting tin large enough to fit the salmon fillets snugly in one layer and cover the bottom with olive oil. Place the salmon fillets, skin-side down, in the tin. Pour over the remaining olive oil, which should just cover the fish (if it doesn’t quite cover it, you will need to baste a couple of times during cooking). Tuck the garlic cloves and thyme sprigs around the fish and cover with foil."
