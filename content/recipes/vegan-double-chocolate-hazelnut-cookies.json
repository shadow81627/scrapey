    "8 oz raw hazelnuts (227g / 1 and 2/3 cups)",
    "83 g rolled oats (1 cup)",
    "124 g gluten-free all-purpose flour (3/4 cup) (I use this blend)",
    "41 g cocoa powder (1/3 cup + 2 tablespoons)",
    "77 g coconut sugar (1/2 cup)",
    "1 tsp baking soda (6g)",
    "3/8 tsp salt (4g)",
    "1/4 tsp xanthan gum (if your flour blend does not include it)",
    "1/4 tsp cinnamon (1g) heaped)",
    "1/2 cup maple syrup (137g)",
    "3 tbsp plain, unsweetened nondairy milk",
    "2 tbsp coconut oil (31g) warm or room temperature)",
    "2 tsp vanilla extract (80g)",
    "2/3 cup dairy-free chocolate chips (114g)"

Remove the pecans from the pan immediately and transfer them into a bowl. Rub the hazelnuts between your hands to loosen and remove the skins as much as possible. It's okay if they don't come off completely (see notes for more tips if you're sensitive to the skins)."

Scrape the mixture out of the food processor and return it to the mixing bowl; stir in the chocolate chips. I find that a strong fork is the best way to get the chocolate chips evenly mixed in, since the dough is quite thick."

      "text": "Take about 1 and 1/2 tablespoons of dough at a time (or more or less, depending on what size you want your cookies to be), roll into a ball, then flatten it as you place it on the baking sheet. These cookies only tend to spread a little bit, but do puff up a little bit, so keep this in mind when spacing out the dough balls. This dough can be very sticky. You may need to stop to clean your hands partway through."
