    "description": "Bean Veggie Fajita Tacos with Cilantro Chile Lime Marinade. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/01/pinto-bean-fajitas-with-cilantro-chile-lime-marinade.html\n\nEasy tacos filled with marinated veggies and beans. This cilantro chile lime marinade is versatile and addictive. Zingy, cilantroey and flavorful. The marinade works wonderfully with any beans, tempeh, meat/chikin subs and veggies. 30 Minute Vegan Lunch!\n\n\nBlend up the marinade. Marinate the beans and veggies for a few minutes. Cook them in a skillet to sear, fill up your tortillas, add toppings and done. This recipe is easily doubled, which you must, because believe me about that marinade. You will want to put it on all kinds of beans and veggies and drizzle more of it on tacos and wraps. \n\nThis recipe is Nut-free, Soy-free. Serve as bowl over greens or with gluten-free tortillas to make gluten-free. \n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: \nhttps://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nMusic: Come to a Stop. by Clueless Kit\nhttp://soundcloud.com/cluelesskit",
