Score fat (not deep down to the meat) evenly with a small, sharp knife, maintaining an even depth all over. Stud with cloves. Place ham into pan and wrap shank with foil. Generously brush all over using about one-third of the glaze. Bake for 1 hour 30 minutes, brushing with remaining glaze every 15 minutes, or until deep golden. Transfer to a platter. Cover with foil. Set aside to rest for 30 minutes before carving."
