    "1 (15 oz) can black beans, drained and rinsed",

    "1 heaping teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1 teaspoon paprika",
    "1 teaspoon garlic powder",

      "text": "Heat oven to 400 degrees F. Using a sharp knife, carefully cut spaghetti squash in half, vertically, and then use a spoon to scoop out the insides. Rub each half with 1/4 teaspoon olive oil and sprinkle with a pinch of salt and pepper. Place squash, cut side up, on a large baking sheet and roast until fork tender, 40-50 mins. You can also do cut side down but I prefer cut side up."

      "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 1/2 teaspoon olive oil, onion and green pepper. Cook until tender, 5 minutes. Next, add in the beans, corn, spaghetti squash, spices and salt and pepper. Stir together and then add the enchilada sauce. Mix once more and then scoop mixture equally back into spaghetti squash skins. There’s a chance you might have a little left over, depending on how big your spaghetti squash is."
