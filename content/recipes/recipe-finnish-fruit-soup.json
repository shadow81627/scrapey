  "recipeIngredient": [
    "3 cups mixed dried fruit (we like to use dried apples, raisins, and apricots, though prunes are a traditional ingredient as well)",
    "1 to 2 cinnamon sticks (depending on the size and strength of the sticks)",
    "1 teaspoon freshly ground cardamom",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
    "1/2 cup granulated sugar, or more to taste",
    "Pinch freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 1/2 tablespoons potato starch",
    "Apple cider vinegar, to taste"

      "text": "Soak the dried fruit overnight in a large bowl with 6 cups water. The fruit will absorb the water and become much larger. If any pieces become larger than bite size, remove them from the water and cut them into smaller pieces."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Pour the fruit and water into a large pot. Add the cinnamon sticks, cardamom, nutmeg, and sugar, along with a pinch of freshly ground black pepper. Cook over medium-high heat until the mixture comes to a boil, and stir until the sugar is dissolved. There should be enough liquid in the pot to cover the fruit. If you need to add more water, do so now. Reduce the heat to low so the mixture is at a simmer."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Mix the potato starch with a little water to create a slurry, then add it to the soup, stirring well to incorporate. Keep simmering until the liquid thickens. Once the liquid thickens to a syrupy consistency and the fruit aroma is strong, add the apple cider vinegar to taste. We typically add 1 to 2 teaspoons."
