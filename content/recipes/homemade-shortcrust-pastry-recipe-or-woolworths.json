  "description": "The pastry dough is here used to blind bake a case for tarts and quiches, but it is also perfect for making single and double crust pies and tartes Tatin. If you get a few cracks and holes as you lift the pastry and line the tin, simply patch them up with excess pastry and glue together with a little water to seal.",
