    "3/4 cup unsweetened dairy-free milk (we used almond)",
    "1/2 cup vegan butter, melted (we like Miyoko’s here)",
    "1/4 cup maple syrup",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1/2 cup coconut sugar (or sub organic cane sugar)",
    "2 1/2 cups almond flour",
    "1 1/2 cups DIY Gluten-Free Flour Blend (see notes for store-bought)",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking powder",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking soda",
    "1/2 tsp cinnamon",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 1/2 cups chopped Granny Smith apples, peeled and cut into 1/2-inch cubes",
    "1/4 cup organic cane sugar",
    "1/4 cup coconut sugar (or sub brown sugar)",
    "1/4 cup vegan butter, melted (we like Miyoko’s here)",

Next, add the coconut sugar, almond flour, gluten-free flour blend, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt and stir until well combined. The texture will be quite thick and will resemble a cookie dough more than a typical cake batter. Add the cubed apples and mix until they are evenly distributed throughout the batter."

Next, begin adding the flour in 1/4 cup (40 g) increments, mixing well with your fork after each addition. You may need more or less flour depending on the brand of your gluten-free blend. Add flour until the texture appears pale and slightly dry and the mixture clumps together easily when you pinch it."
