    "1/4 cup rolled oats (if grain-free, try subbing chopped roasted nuts like peanuts or almonds)",

If it’s too dry or crumbly and it doesn’t stick together when pressed between two fingers, add more nut butter or pitted dates (just ensure your dates are sticky and fresh, or it will only further dry out the mixture.)"
