    "2 medium ripe bananas (yellow with brown spots)",
    "2 tsp baking powder (not necessary, but helps them rise)",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract ( (or sub another extract or citrus zest of choice)",
    "2 large eggs (free-range, organic when possible — we like Vital Farms)",
    "4-6 Tbsp coconut flour*",
    "Oil (such as coconut or avocado — for cooking)",

      "text": "We’ve found that while these pancakes cook well on the stove-top, it can be helpful to keep them warm in the oven where they will continue to bake and firm up while the remaining pancakes cook. If this sounds helpful, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. However, this is not necessary, meaning you can skip this step."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "To a large mixing bowl, add bananas and mash until only small bits remain. Then add baking powder and vanilla extract and use a fork or whisk to mash until thoroughly combined."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Next add eggs, break yolks with a fork or whisk, and whisk thoroughly until well combined."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Lastly, add coconut flour 1 Tbsp (9 g) at a time until a thick but scoopable batter is achieved (thicker than your average pancake batter, but not so thick that it appears dry). If you add too much coconut flour, add a little dairy-free milk to thin."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add a little cooking oil to coat the pan. Then spoon in roughly 3-Tbsp amounts of batter and reduce heat to low. These benefit from cooking slower and lower than your average pancakes. Cover with a lid to help the center cook through."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Cook for 3-4 minutes, then remove lid and flip carefully. Cook for 3-4 minutes more (lowering heat as needed if cooking too fast) or until the underside is golden brown. Transfer cooked pancakes to the preheated oven on the prepared baking sheet (or to a serving plate). Continue cooking until all batter is used up — as recipe is written, ~6 pancakes."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "To serve, top with desired toppings, such as nut butter, sliced bananas or fresh fruit, dairy-free yogurt, or maple syrup. We also love a sprinkle of seeds for more fiber and healthy fats."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Best when fresh, though leftovers keep covered in the refrigerator 3-4 days, or in the freezer up to 1 month. To reheat, microwaving is most effective. Otherwise, toast or bake in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven until hot."
