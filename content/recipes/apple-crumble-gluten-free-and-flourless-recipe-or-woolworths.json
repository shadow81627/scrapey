Scatter over the apple and date mixture. Bake for 35-40 minutes or until golden and apple is tender. Stand for 5 minutes before serving. Serve with thick cream, if using. Tip 1: Use rolled oats instead of quinoa flakes in this recipe. You can use dried dates if fresh are unavailable. Tip 2: This crumble is great served in plastic airtight containers cold in lunch boxes the next day. Tip 3: This dessert can be made in individual ramekins."
