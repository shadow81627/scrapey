At the last minute before rolling your sushi add in the watermelon and toss to combine. The first time I made this I thought it would be a good idea to let the watermelon marinate in the sauce. Wrong. When you do that the watermelon gets all watery making a saucy mess, so toss the watermelon with the sauce just before using in sushi."

Fill with watermelon and a sprinkle of sesame seeds. I used both black and white sesame seeds but you can use whatever kind you like. Carefully roll the sushi up, and when you reach the top, lightly wet the exposed nori with water to help glue the roll closed, then finish rolling. Wet a sharp knife and cut into sushi rounds. If any watermelon falls out, simply push it back in."
