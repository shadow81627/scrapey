    "text": "Make ahead: The pizzas can be assembled and refrigerated unbaked up to 1 day in advance, or frozen for up to 1 month. Freeze on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet until solid then transfer to an airtight container or large zip-top bag. Bake straight from the freezer (no need to thaw) at 375°F until the cheese is melted and the pizzas are heated through, about 15 minutes.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."
