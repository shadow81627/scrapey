    "2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled and chopped into large bite-sized pieces",
    "4 medium carrots, peeled and chopped into large bite-sized pieces",
    "Water",
    "2-3 Tbsp dairy-free butter (we prefer Miyoko's or Earth Balance // if not vegan, sub organic dairy butter)",
    "2 cloves garlic, minced",
    "1/4 tsp ground ginger",
    "1/2 tsp ground turmeric",

      "text": "Bring water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, slightly reduce heat to medium-high and continue cooking at a slightly less rapid boil for about 10-15 minutes, or until the potatoes and carrots are very tender (they should easily fall off a knife when pierced)."

Add butter of choice, minced garlic, ginger, turmeric, and sea salt to taste. Mash (or purée) until smooth. We found a food processor to give the creamiest texture, but mashing works fine, too (it just leaves a bit more texture)."
