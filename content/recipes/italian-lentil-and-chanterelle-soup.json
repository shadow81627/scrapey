  "headline": "Italian Lentil and Chanterelle Soup",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "SubstitutionsAny type of small, nutty mushroom like girolles, pioppini, or even finely sliced fresh porcini would work great in place of chanterelles.Opt for Umbrian Castelluccio lentils or any type of brown lentils that can hold their shape. Grana Padano cheese can be used instead of Parmesan.Dairy free/vegan: Cook the mushrooms in olive oil instead of butter and skip the Parmesan.Make ahead: The soup and the mushrooms can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated. Rewarm separately and top the soup with the warm mushrooms.Storage: Once cool, refrigerate the soup and mushrooms in separate airtight containers for up to 5 days or freeze for up to 2 months. Thaw before reheating with an additional splash of hot water or vegetable stock."
