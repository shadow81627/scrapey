Lightly brush off any dirt or debris from the portobella mushrooms and then drizzle each cap with 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 tablespoon of red wine vinegar, and a slight sprinkle of salt and pepper (both sides). Place the seasoned mushrooms on the prepared baking sheet (gill side down) and roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes."

Use a small amount of the reserved pasta water to loosen the pasta if it becomes dry. Add the parmesan cheese and toss to coat once again. If desired, add an extra splash of red wine vinegar before serving"
