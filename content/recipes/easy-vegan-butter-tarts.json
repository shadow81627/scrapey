I had a latte mug that was the perfect size so I used that to cut my pastry. Fit the pastry circles into 8 wells a muffin pan, wobbly edges are totally ok and are authentic for butter tarts."

Divide the butter-sugar mixture among each tart shell covering the raisins, about 1 1/2 tablespoons of liquid per tart. The tarts will be about 2/3rd full which is perfect. Optionally, you can top the tarts with pecans or walnuts. I did half with pecans and half without."
