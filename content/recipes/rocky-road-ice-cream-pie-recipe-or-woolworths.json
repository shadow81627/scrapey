Make sure the mixture is as packed as possible and that it climbs at least 3cm up the sides of the tin. Bake for 10 minutes, then set aside to cool. Once cold, cover, and store in the fridge until needed."

Spoon it into a food processor (don’t tip the whole block in as it will be too hard to break down). Process until creamy and smooth. Scrape it into a bowl and fold in most of the marshmallows and nuts. Pour into the prepared case and freeze for 1 hour, or until firm."
