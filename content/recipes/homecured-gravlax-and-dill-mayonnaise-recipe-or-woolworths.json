    "1 tsp freshly ground black pepper",
    "50g dill, finely chopped, stalks included",
    "800g very fresh salmon, most of a side of salmon, from the centre of the fillet",
    "1 loaf rye bread (to serve)",
    "2 large egg, yolks only",
    "1 tbs rice wine vinegar",
    "2 tbs Dijon mustard",

Lay 1 piece, skin-side down, on the edge of a roll of cling film. Cover the flesh of the fish with the dill mixture, then put the second piece of salmon on top of the first, skin-side up."

      "text": "Wrap the salmon a few times in the cling film, being careful to wrap both lengthways and widthways so it is entirely enclosed in a tight parcel. Place on a trivet in a deep roasting tray. Refrigerate the salmon for 3 days, turning it morning and evening so that each side of the fish gets soaked in the marinade."

      "text": "After 3 days, carefully unwrap the fish  there will be a lot of juice from the marinade. Put the fish, skin-side down, on a chopping board and gently scrape away most of the dill that remains on top of the flesh with a sharp knife."

      "text": "To make the mayonnaise, put the egg yolks, vinegar, mustard, dill, and sugar into the bowl of a food processor or blender, and season well. Add a little of the oil and process to a smooth paste. With the motor running, slowly add the remaining oil in a thin stream, until the mixture thickens and emulsifies. Taste and adjust the acidity with more vinegar, if needed. Refrigerate until needed, and for up to 1 day."
