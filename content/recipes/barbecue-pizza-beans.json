  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Substitutions: For a really fast version, use 1 (28-ounce) or 2 (15-ounce) can(s) baked beans instead of the cooked beans and barbecue sauce.Beans: If you’re cooking dried beans, cook 10 ounces to get 3 cups cooked.Make ahead: The beans can be assembled, covered, and refrigerated up to 1 day ahead. Bake in a 350ºF oven until warmed through and the cheeses starts to melt, then switch the oven to broil. Broil until the cheeses are browned in spots.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."
