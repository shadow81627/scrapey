Tip 1: Cutting base - To level cakes: measure from the flat base up and insert toothpicks around the cake. Place a hand on the top of cake and, with a large knife, slowly slice through the cake, using the toothpicks as a guide. Tip 2: Cutting blocks - Cut the second cake in the same way. Stick the two halves together with icing. Measure into 6 even pieces and mark the blocks with toothpicks. Cut into cubes, using the toothpicks as a guide."
