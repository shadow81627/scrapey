Reduce the heat to a simmer and stir the polenta until it becomes thick and creamy, approximately 5 minutes.NOTE: It's really important to slowly add the polenta to the water while constantly whisking. This will prevent lumps from forming. Once the polenta is smooth, you can swap the whisk out for a spoon to stir it until it's thick and creamy."
