    "description": "Instant Pot Tomato Soup with Cornmeal Crusted Tofu Croutons. Saucepan Option.\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/03/instant-pot-tomato-soup-tofu-croutons.html\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡MY COOKBOOK: https://veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nThis soup is Gorgeous, delicious and super easy. Just blend up the ingredients, pour into the instant pot with some herbs, pressure cook for five minutes and you are done. I top the soup with crispy tofu croutons that work wonderfully. \n\nOregano, dill and basil add the flavor. Cashew or Coconut milk add creamyness. The soup can easily be made without tofu with other croutons (bread croutons, roasted chickpeas etc), without nuts with coconut milk and oil free by sauteing in broth. Try this delicious soup with Extra black pepper for the chilly days. The soup can also be easily made in a saucepan, see recipe notes. For variation, change up the herbs, add some red lentils (1/4 cup) with the tomato mix for a hearty soup.
