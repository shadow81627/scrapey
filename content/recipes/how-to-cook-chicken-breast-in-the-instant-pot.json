    "text": "Frozen chicken: This method works well with frozen chicken as well, just keep in mind that frozen breasts cool the cooker’s insert and make for a longer cooker time, as the pressure cooker needs more time to come to pressure. Storage: Cooked chicken can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. "

    "description": "The first thing I suggest making in your brand new electric pressure cooker is hard-cooked eggs (seriously, so easy to peel). The second? Basic chicken breast! This dinner staple cooks up perfectly every time in the Instant Pot. You can aim for firm but juicy chicken for cubing, or let it cook a little bit longer for tender shredded chicken. Instant Pot chicken breast is also as ingenious for meal prep (hello, more oven space!) as it is for weeknight dinners. You can even cook frozen chicken breast this way while you figure out the rest of dinner. Ready for the simple steamed chicken breast technique you'll use over and over again?",
