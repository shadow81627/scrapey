  "recipeIngredient": [
    "4 tbs good-quality lemon curd",
    "5 egg, whites only (at room temperature)",
    "225g caster sugar",
    "0.5 tsp white wine vinegar",
    "1 tsp cornflour",
    "0.5 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1 cup double cream",
    "2 tbs icing sugar (for dusting)"

      "text": "Preheat the oven to 180°C (Gas 4) and line a 25 x 35cm Swiss roll tin with baking parchment. Whisk the egg whites with an electric hand-held whisk on high speed, until stiff peaks form. Reduce the speed and whisk in the sugar, a little at a time, until thick and glossy."

      "text": "Mix the vinegar, cornflour, and vanilla extract and fold them in, trying to keep the mixture as well aerated as possible. Spread the mixture into the tin, and bake in the centre of the oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set it aside. Allow it to cool to room temperature."

      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Meanwhile, whisk the cream until thick but not stiff; it should remain unctuous. Fold in the lemon curd roughly until just mixed; a few ripples will enhance the roulade. Sprinkle icing sugar over a fresh sheet of baking parchment."

      "text": "Carefully turn the cooled roulade out of the tin onto the sugared parchment. Spread the lemon cream over the unbaked side of the roulade with a palette knife. Use the parchment to roll up the meringue firmly, but without squeezing out the cream. Place seam-side down on a serving plate, cover, and chill until needed. Sift over icing sugar to serve."
