Meanwhile, finely grate the zest of 1 medium lemon, then cut the lemon into wedges. Drain and rinse 1 can white beans. Heat the remaining 4 tablespoons olive oil in a large pot over medium heat until shimmering. When it shimmers, add the sliced fennel and cook, stirring frequently, until just beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Carefully lift the light green and white parts of the leeks from the water, being careful to leave the grit in the bottom of the bowl, and add them to the pot. Add the lemon zest and 1 teaspoon kosher salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until the leeks are soft, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from the heat."
