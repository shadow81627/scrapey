      "text": "Put the sausagemeat in a dry frying pan and cook over a medium heat for 5 minutes, or until no longer pink. While it is cooking, mash it with the back of a fork or a wooden spatula so it becomes crumbly. Stir through the Parmesan cheese (if using), and season with salt and black pepper."

      "text": "Place the dough on a floured surface and use a rolling pin to roll it out as thinly as you can - about 25-30cm in diameter. Sprinkle the hot baking tray with semolina and transfer the dough onto it. Cover the pizza base with tomato slices and bake for 5 minutes, or until the tomatoes are soft, then remove from the oven and spoon the sausage mixture on top. Bake for a further 10 minutes, or until the crust and base are golden and crispy."
