  "description": "This vegan chili recipe has won 1st place at a chili cook-off competition competing against non-vegan recipes! Bursting with gorgeous spices, the double-bean action makes for a scrumptious heartiness, the rich simmered tomatoes, and that chewy, totally addictive tofu will make this chili super meaty. That&#39;s why this is The Best Vegan Chili Ever!!!",

Add in the tomatoes, beans, water, and all of the spices. Bring to a boil and reduce to simmer and continue to simmer for 1 hour. If the chili gets too thick, just splash in more water to reach desired consistency."

Open and drain the tofu (no need to press it), then break off chunks and crumble with your fingers into the bowl. Do this with all of the tofu until you have a large bowl of crumbles.

You want the tofu to be nice and browned. The smaller crumbles will be darker than the larger crumbles, and that's ok because it will provide a variety of texture."
