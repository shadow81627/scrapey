Stir occasionally as it cooks, to stop it sticking to the base of the pan, and add a dash of water if necessary. Remove from the heat. Arrange the soba noodles on a warmed serving dish, pile the kale on top, and scatter over the toasted walnuts. Sprinkle a few drops of walnut oil over the dish and serve."
