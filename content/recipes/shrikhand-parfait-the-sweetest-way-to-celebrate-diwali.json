  "description": "A recipe for Indian shrikhand parfait, from the cookbook Milk &amp; Cardamom by Hetal Vasavada.",
  "headline": "Shrikhand Parfait: The Sweetest Way to Celebrate Diwali",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Note: There are two types of cardamom: green and black. Black cardamom is dried over a fire pit, giving it a smoky, savory flavor. Green cardamom is picked before the plant reaches maturity and is sold as is, without any processing. The light floral, vanilla-like flavor of green cardamom is found in almost every Indian dessert. I like to think of it as the vanilla of India!Reprinted with permission from Milk &amp; Cardamom by Hetal Vasavada, Â© 2019 Page Street Publishing"
