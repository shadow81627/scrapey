Cut out with a 2 inch round cookie cutter and place on a parchment paper lined cookie sheet. The first half of the dough should make approximately 12 to 16 cookies. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown. Place the cookie sheet on a cooling rack and let cool for a few minutes. Put a flower on the center of the cookie and gently brush with a light layer of olive oil. Put back in the oven for 1 or 2 minutes until the flower adheres to the cookie. The petals will shrink slightly."
