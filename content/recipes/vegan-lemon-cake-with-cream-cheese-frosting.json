    "description": "Vegan Lemon Cake with Cream Cheese Frosting. No added refined sugar. GF option\nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/05/vegan-lemon-cake-with-cream-cheese-frosting.html\nðŸ’™ MY COOKBOOK: https://veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nThis Cake is Zesty, lemony, Soft, Moist, Sumerry and everything I want in a Lemon Cake. A super easy Cake with loads of lemon juice and zest covered with 4 ingredient vegan cream cheese frosting. I use kite cream cheese or a cashew based home made cream cheese. A simple glaze with a few tsp lemon juice and half cup powdered sugar will work wonderfully as well. \n\nIt takes just a few minutes to put together and then it is the excruciating wait time to bake, cool and frost! All maple syrup, no refined sugar in the cake or the frosting. The batter can be baked into cupcakes, baked donuts or a loaf like my Cinnamon Swirl Loaf which is getting made every day on Instagram! \nMore Cakes: https://www.veganricha.com/?s=cake\nGluten-free Cakes and Baking: https://www.veganricha.com/category/gluten-free/gluten-free-baking\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOKS: http://www.veganricha.com/mybooks\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\nðŸ’™ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nðŸ’™ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nðŸ’™ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttps://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n\nMusic: Bensound - Energy",
