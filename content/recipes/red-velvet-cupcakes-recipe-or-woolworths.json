Add half the flour mixture, coloring, vanilla, vinegar, and half the buttermilk. Whisk well. Add the remaining flour and buttermilk. Whisk again for 30 seconds. Divide the mixture between the paper cases so they are two-thirds full. Bake for 40-45 minutes or until the centers spring back when lightly touched. Cool for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
