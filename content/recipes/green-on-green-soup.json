  "description": "If you’re turned off by thick, green liquids or just don’t like greens at all, this probably isn’t the soup for you. But if you’re brave enough to give it a try, I think you’ll like it. It grows on you—in a good way! I had it for lunch three days this week, and I liked it better each time. And my husband took it for lunch one day and came home raving about it.",

    "2 teaspoons oregano",
    "1 teaspoon celery salt (optional)",
    "1 teaspoon thyme",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "3 tablespoons nutritional yeast",
    "1/2 cup finely chopped fresh or frozen basil (or about 2 tablespoons dried*)",

Add the next 6 ingredients (*and the dried basil, if you’re using it) and cook for about 30-45 minutes, until greens are completely tender. Add additional water if necessary to prevent soup from becoming too dry."

Check seasoning and add salt as needed, and thin with a little water if you find it too thick. Serve with additional lemon or try it with a spoonful of plain soy yogurt stirred in."
