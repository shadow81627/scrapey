    "2/3 cup hemp seeds",
    "1/4 cup chia seeds (or sub other seeds, such as sesame or flax)",
    "3-4 Tbsp protein powder*",

We recommend storing these in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer up to 1 month for best texture. They are delicious straight out of the refrigerator or freezer and tend to soften at room temperature."
