    "text": "Make ahead: Prepare the mac and cheese up until baking. Let cool completely then refrigerate wrapped tightly in plastic wrap for up to 3 days or freeze for up to 3 months. If baking from frozen, thaw in the refrigerator overnight. Bake until cheese is melted and mac and cheese is warmed through, about 40 minutes. Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days. "
