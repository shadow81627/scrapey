    "2 tbsp green curry paste",
    "1 tbsp soy sauce (or tamari)",

Place kabobs in the dish, cover and transfer the dish to the refrigerator, and allow the kabobs to marinate for at least two hours, up to a day. Turn the kabobs every 30 minutes or so and brush them with the coconut curry marinade to make sure as much flavor soaks in as possible!"

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "If you're using an indoor grill, heat it to high, spray the grates with oil or cooking spray, and cook the kabobs for about 10 minutes on each side, or until veggies are seared and tender, occasionally basting with extra marinade. For charcoal and gas grills, brush oil onto the grill rack and cook the kabobs until they're done, turning and basting occasionally. It shouldn't be more than 10 minutes, but grills vary so much in how they cook, it's hard to be precise. Just keep an eye on the kabobs!"
