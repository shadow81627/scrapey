  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1/4 cup sundried tomatoes (see notes)",
    "1 and 3/4 cups TVP",
    "2 cups low-sodium vegetable broth (hot (I recommend low-sodium for better control over the soyrizo's saltiness)",
    "1/4 cup red wine vinegar",
    "3 tbsp tomato paste",
    "3 tbsp tamari (or use low-sodium soy sauce)",
    "1/2 tbsp olive oil",
    "1/2 large white or yellow onion (minced)",
    "3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "1 tsp cayenne pepper (use less if this is your first time making the recipe)",
    "1/4 tsp ancho chili powder (or 1/2 tsp. regular chili powder) (omit if using hot paprika)",
    "2 tsp dried thyme",
    "2 tbsp dried oregano",
    "1/2 tsp ground allspice",
    "1/4 tsp ground cloves",
    "2 tbsp smoked paprika",
    "1/2 tbsp ground black pepper (if using freshly ground, reduce to 3/4 tsp)",
    "1 tsp ground coriander",
    "1 and 1/2 tbsp ground cumin",
    "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon"
