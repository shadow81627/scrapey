  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 12-ounce package extra firm tofu",
    "2 Tbsp sesame oil (divided)",
    "4 Tbsp reduced-sodium tamari (or soy sauce if not GF)",
    "3 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "2 Tbsp almond butter (or sub peanut butter)",
    "2 Tbsp lime juice",
    "1-2 tsp chili garlic sauce",
    "1 pound green beans (trimmed)",
    "2-3 small spicy peppers (I used cherry bomb - use bell peppers for less heat)",
    "Brown rice*, white rice*, or Cauliflower Rice"

      "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Also wrap tofu in a clean, absorbent towel and set something heavy on top - like a cast-iron skillet - to press out excess moisture."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once oven is preheated, unwrap tofu and cut into small cubes. Arrange on the lined baking sheet in an even layer and bake for 25-30 minutes or until puffy, dried out, and slightly crispy on the edges (see photo). This step helps crisp up the tofu. The longer you bake it, the firmer and crispier it will get, so adjust cooking time accordingly."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "In the meantime, to a small mixing bowl, add half of the sesame oil (1 Tbsp as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), tamari, maple syrup, almond butter, lime juice, and chili garlic sauce/red pepper flake/Thai chilies. Whisk to combine. Then taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more almond butter for creaminess / nuttiness, tamari for saltiness, lime juice for acidity, or chili garlic sauce for heat. Set aside."

Cover to steam for about 4-5 minutes or until green beans are slightly tender. Then remove lid, increase heat to medium high, and add remaining marinade and the tofu. Cook for an additional 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently. Then remove from heat."
