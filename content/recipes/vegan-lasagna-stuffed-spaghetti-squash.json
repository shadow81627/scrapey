Scoop out the seeds and the stringy membrane and generously brush each half with olive oil. Flip the squash over so that they are face-side down on a baking sheet. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the squash is tender and has started to brown on the edges."

Add the vegan “beef”, breaking it up with the back of a wooden spoon as you stir. Cook the beef until it is brown on all sides. Add the tomato sauce and spices. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes while the squash finishes cooking."

      "text": "Once the squash is tender, remove it from the oven and gently pull apart the squash with a fork. It will create stringy squash pieces similar to pasta. Remove as much as you can from the bottoms, reserving at least 1/2′′ on the sides for support. Stir the squash into the meat sauce and set aside."

Top the squash with your meat sauce, mounding the top and packing it down as you fill. Top with additional vegan mozzarella and return to the oven for 15 minutes, until the filling is heated all the way through. (See recipe tips before for extra melty cheese sauce)."
