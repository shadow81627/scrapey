(You will probably need about 4-6 tbsps of water) Add extra water only if needed to make a nice icing paste. Spread the icing over the slice with a knife. If you do this while your slice is still warm it will be easier to spread. Sprinkle the remaining 4 tbsps of coconut evenly over the icing. Leave to set for about an hour and then cut up while still in the tray."
