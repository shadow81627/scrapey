Add the onion and a pinch of salt, and sweat gently for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the leeks, and continue to sweat gently for about 10 minutes until softened. Remove from the heat, stir in the flour, and add a little of the cider. Return to the heat, pour in the remaining cider, and cook for 5-8 minutes until thickened."

      "text": "Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface so that it is about 5cm larger all around than the top of the pie dish. Cut out a strip of pastry about 2.5cm in from the edge to make a collar. Wet the edge of the pie dish with a little water; fit the pastry strip all the way around, and press down firmly. Brush the pastry collar with a little of the egg wash, then top with the pastry lid. Trim away the excess, and pinch together the edges to seal. Using a sharp knife, make 2 slits in the top to allow steam to escape."
