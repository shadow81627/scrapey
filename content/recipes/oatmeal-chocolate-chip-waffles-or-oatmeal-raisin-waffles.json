Serve with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, vegan butter, berries, fruits etc. Store: You can store these in the refrigerator for up to 5 days and freeze them for up to 2 months. When freezing, I would recommend you wrap the waffles individually in parchment and place them all in a large freezer bag.To reheat them, pop them in the toaster oven or the waffle maker."
