With my list complete and my focus narrowed on a springtime refresh, I reach for fresh herbs, tender chicken breasts, and the first juicy tomatoes I've seen in months. Brimming with the fragrance of fresh basil and buttery pine nuts, I build a simple, homemade pesto to mix with hearty chunks of chicken in the slow cooker, ready for a week's worth of salads, wraps, and grain bowls.",
