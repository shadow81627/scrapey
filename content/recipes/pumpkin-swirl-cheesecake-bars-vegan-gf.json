The mixture should hold together when squeezed in your hand. If too dry, add the extra coconut oil. Transfer the mixture to the lined 8x8 dish and spread evenly. Place parchment paper on top and press the dough into your pan using a flat-bottomed object, such as a drinking glass, to firmly and evenly distribute the crust."

To the now empty blender, add your reserved 1/2 cup (120 ml) cheesecake batter, your remaining 1/2 cup (100 g) pumpkin purée, and your remaining 2 tsp pumpkin pie spice (if altering batch size, adjust amounts accordingly).
