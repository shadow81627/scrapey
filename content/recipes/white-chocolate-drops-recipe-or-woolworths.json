Place 50 g plain chocolate in a heatproof bowl and melt over a saucepan of gently simmering water. Dip one-quarter of each cooled biscuit in the chocolate, then dip the chocolate-coated edge of the biscuits in 50 g desiccated coconut. Place on a tray in the refrigerator for 20 minutes to allow the chocolate to set, then store the biscuits in an airtight container. There will be plenty of leftover chocolate and coconut, but you will need this quantity so that the job of dipping the biscuits is not too fiddly."
