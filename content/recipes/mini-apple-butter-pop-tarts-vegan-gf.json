If it seems too dry and isn’t holding together when pressed between your fingers, add the additional tablespoon of maple syrup."

Use a rolling pin to roll the dough out into a rectangle ~1/8-inch thick and about 10x15 inches, adding more flour as needed to prevent sticking."

      "text": "Transfer the dough (still on the parchment/wax paper) to a baking sheet and pop in the freezer for about 5-8 minutes. This will help it firm up and become easier to assemble. If using unsweetened/unspiced apple butter, combine it with the optional maple syrup and cinnamon and set nearby."

Using a spatula to pick up each piece, carefully place one rectangle of dough onto the prepared baking sheet and add ~1 tsp of apple butter to the center of the dough, leaving half an inch of dough on the outside. Then place another rectangle on top. Repeat this with the rest of the dough, then use your fingers or a fork to crimp and seal all the edges. Use a paring knife to cut a small X into the center of each pop tart (to prevent cracking) and sprinkle cane sugar on each pop tart (optional)."
