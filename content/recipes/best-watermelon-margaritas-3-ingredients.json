One small watermelon should yield roughly 3-5 cups (720-1200 ml), so you will have leftover juice (as original recipe is written) for extra margaritas. You can choose to strain the juice through a fine mesh strainer to remove any seeds or pulp, but I didn't find it necessary."

    "description": "The best Watermelon Margaritas with just 3 ingredients! Naturally sweet from the watermelon, tangy from the lime, and spiked with silver tequila!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/best-watermelon-margaritas-3-ingredients/\n\nThere are several theories of where the margarita first originated and we’re not sure which one is true! But the most popular is that it was created in 1938 by Carlos ‘Danny’ Herrera at his restaurant in Tijuana, Mexico. It’s thought that he created it for a customer who was allergic to all hard alcohol except tequila, but wanted something more than just a shot. Our inspired version varies from a traditional margarita with the addition of watermelon. \n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
