    "text": "You can add a protein like shrimp, chicken or tofu to the stir-fry. Increase the amount of sauce and stir-fry the protein for a few minutes before adding the garlic.Although I like this recipe best with dark green, leafy, slightly bitter vegetables, the sauce will work with virtually any sturdy vegetable (cauliflower, carrots, celery, etc.), so feel free to mix it up."

Stir and toss the vegetables frequently until the leaves are wilted and the stalks are tender, about 3-5 minutes."
