  "description": "These delicious Grilled Tricolor Hasselback Potatoes with Romesco Sauce are a combination of two of our favorite Spanish dishes: “Patatas Bravas” (roasted potatoes with spicy sauce) and “Romesco”, a traditional Spanish sauce/spread that is served along with grilled vegetables, meats or with toasted rustic bread. This dish is vegan and can be served as an appetizer or side dish and can be made for Passover as well.",

Using a sharp paring knife and starting from one end, cut thin slices, stopping before reaching the bottom (make sure you don't cut all the way through), keeping the cuts as even as possible. Repeat the process with the rest of the potatoes. It helps to place a chopstick on each side of the potato, to prevent you from cutting all the way through."

Cover and cook for 30 minutes or until tender. At the same time, place the foil-wrapped garlic in the grill, and remove it after 15 minutes or until soft."
