      "text": "Serve chicken, thickly sliced with chickpea and cucumber salad. Tip 1: Swap the chicken thigh fillets with lamb chops or eggplant; and chickpeas with other canned pulses such as lentils or white beans. Tip 2: Leftovers are great in pita pockets for lunch the next day. Tip 3: Make ahead â€“ the chicken can be marinated up to 24 hours in advance. The salad can be made a day in advance and dressed with the oil, lemon juice and cumin just before serving."
