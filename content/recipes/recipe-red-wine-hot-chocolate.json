    "description": "Put down the boozy eggnog and don't even think about ordering another Pumpkin Spice Latte, because I have the most exciting winter drink for you to try right now. We wrote about red wine hot chocolate a couple months ago, after we saw it popping up on Pinterest, and instantly knew we needed to create a recipe for our readers. Red wine hot chocolate really is as simple and delicious as it sounds; it's something to enjoy with friends after a wintery meal, or by yourself curled up on the couch on a snowy day. Grab an inexpensive bottle of red at your local wine store tonight and make your boozy chocolate dreams come to life.",
