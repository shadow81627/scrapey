  "description": "These vegan lentil burgers contain no soy, nuts, gluten or oil and are made with natural ingredients you probably have in your kitchen. Mushrooms add umami! They come together quickly if you have cooked lentils on-hand. I cooked 1 1/2 cups of lentils with a little dried thyme and black pepper in 3 cups water for about 30 minutes and had enough lentils for this recipe and about a cup leftover.",

Add the chia seed mixture and all remaining ingredients and pulse to combine well. Itâ€™s okay if a few lentils remain whole, but the mixture should be more sticky than crumbly. If it seems too wet, add a little more oats."
