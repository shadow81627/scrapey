    "1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 onion (chopped)",
    "1 large zucchini (chopped)",
    "1 small eggplant (cut into 1/2-inch chunks)",
    "2 large ears corn (kernels removed)",
    "1 pint cherry tomatoes (halved)",
    "1 clove garlic (minced)",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes",
    "2 1/2 cups canned tomato sauce",
    "12 uncooked lasagna noodles",

Add in the zucchini, eggplant, corn, tomatoes, garlic, salt and red pepper flakes. Cook for 7 to 9 minutes, until the veggies are tender. Remove from the heat, taste and season with additional salt and red pepper flakes if needed."

Using a slotted spoon, top with 1/3 of the vegetable mixture, then 1/2 cup of the sauce and 1/3 cup of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat this process two more times -- noodles, vegetables, sauce, cheese. End with a final layer of noodles and the remaining 1/2 cup of the sauce. Sprinkle the top with the remaining 1/3 cup mozzarella, the parmesan and panko."

      "text": "Cover and cook on low for about 3 1/2 to 4 hours, until the noodles are cooked through. Turn off the slow cooker and let sit uncovered for 20 to 30 minutes before serving. This will let the lasagna set so you can cut it easily and it will hold its shape. Sprinkle the top with fresh basil before serving."
