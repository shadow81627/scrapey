Continue cooking, swirling the pan occasionally, until the cracking sounds stop, about 2 minutes. Continue to swirl the pan or stir with a heatproof spatula until brown bits start to form at the bottom and the butter starts to smell nutty. When the bits are amber in color and the butter is light brown, immediately remove from the heat. Scrape into a medium heatproof bowl, making sure to scrape all the browned solids into the bowl. Add 1 teaspoon water and set aside to cool slightly."
