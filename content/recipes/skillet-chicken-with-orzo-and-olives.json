    "4 chicken thighs (bone-in, skin on) ($5.66)",

    "4 cloves garlic, minced ($0.24)",
    "1 15oz. can diced tomatoes* ($0.89)",
    "1/3 cup pitted kalamata olives ($1.62)",
    "1/2 tsp dried oregano ($0.05)",

Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken thighs with the skin side down. Cook the chicken thighs on each side until golden brown (about 5-7 minutes each side), then remove to a clean plate."

Nestle the browned chicken thighs down into the skillet, place a lid on the skillet and turn the heat up to medium-high. Allow the skillet to come to a boil, then turn the heat down to low, or the lowest temperature needed to maintain a gentle simmer. Let the skillet simmer for 15 minutes with the lid in place."

The tomatoes and olives will have risen to the top, so use a fork to gently stir or fluff the orzo, tomatoes, and olives back together. The orzo should be tender and slightly saucy.
