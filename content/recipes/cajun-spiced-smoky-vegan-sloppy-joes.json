    "description": "Amazing Cajun Spiced Sloppy Lentils. Easily GF\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/07/cajun-spiced-smoky-vegan-sloppy-joes.html\n\n\nSmoky Vegan Sloppy Joes with Cajun Spices. Serve between soft buns, dinner rolls, pita pockets or tacos. Vegan Nut-free Recipe. Soy free option. Easily Gluten-free. \n\nThese sloppy lentils are easy and amazingly delicious. I use Red lentils in this recipe as they are less earthy than whole brown lentils and also cook faster. If you cook them in parallel the meal is ready within 30 minutes!  \n\nThe sloppy lentils are also very versatile. Use them to make taquitos, tacos, wraps, fill up pita pockets, grilled quesadillas or sandwiches, or fill up baked potatoes for a taco baked potato and dress with salsa and vegan sour cream. Many options!\n\nFor texture I use shredded zucchini and carrots that add volume and texture to the mix. You can also use some shredded sweet potato or other vegetables.\n\nMore Sandwiches and Burgers: https://www.veganricha.com/category/burger\n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: Passenger Seat by Clueless Kit. \nhttps://soundcloud.com/cluelesskit",
