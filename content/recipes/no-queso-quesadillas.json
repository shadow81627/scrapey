  "description": "I think these quesadillas taste best when they’re filled with something in addition to the cheesy sauce. I made them both plain and with spinach, but you can experiment with other fillings. Just don’t add too much or the whole thing may fall apart as you flip it. And be sure to pre-cook any vegetables that you don’t want crunchy.",
