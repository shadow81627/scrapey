Thinly slice 4 medium scallions, keeping the white and green parts separate. Pat 4 salmon fillets dry with paper towels, then season on both sides with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper."

Add the carrots and scallion whites, and season with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper. Sauté until the carrots are crisp-tender, about 5 minutes.

Cover and cook the salmon to desired doneness, 2 to 5 minutes depending on the thickness of the fillets. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the middle of the thickest fillet should register 120°F to 130°F for medium-rare or 135°F to 145°F if you prefer it more well-done. Sprinkle with the scallion greens."
