  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 large eggplant",
    "4 Tbsp coconut aminos (or sub tamari, only slightly reduce as it's saltier)",
    "1-2 Tbsp avocado oil (or other neutral oil for grilling)",
    "2 tsp smoked paprika",
    "2 tsp ground cumin",
    "2 tsp ground coriander",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1/2 tsp garlic powder",
    "1/2 tsp cayenne pepper (or red pepper flake // omit for less spicy)",
    "Fresh Parsley",
    "Garlic Dill Sauce (or Tahini)",
    "Extra Virgin Olive Oil"

      "text": "Slice the eggplant into 1/4-inch rounds and place on a baking sheet. Drizzle the coconut aminos and half the oil over eggplant and use a brush or your hands to massage into the eggplant. The oil helps prevent sticking while grilling, and the coconut aminos infuses flavor."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add all the spices to a small dish and mix to combine. Then sprinkle over both sides of the eggplant and use your fingers to spread it around so it's well coated."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat a grill or grill pan over medium-high heat. Once hot, brush the grill surface with a little oil to further prevent sticking. Then add eggplant. It can be helpful to place something heavy on top of the eggplant while it's grilling (like a cast-iron pan or heavy plate) to impress the eggplant into the grooves of the grill to make more pronounced grill marks. Grill on both sides for about 3 minutes or until the eggplant becomes a little tender and grill marks are pronounced."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Plate the eggplant and enjoy as is or garnish with tahini, garlic dill sauce, fresh herbs, or a little olive oil. This is delicious on its own, but I especially enjoy it with hummus, in a Mediterranean-themed bowl, or in a salad."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Best when fresh, though leftovers can be stored in the refrigerator up to 3 days. Reheat in a cast-iron pan over medium heat until hot."
