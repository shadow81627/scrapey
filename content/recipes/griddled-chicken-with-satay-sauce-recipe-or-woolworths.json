Reduce the heat slightly, and simmer until it releases its sweet fragrance. Now stir through the curry paste, add the stock and sugar, and simmer for a further 5 minutes. Add the peanut butter, and stir for a few more minutes until well blended. Remove from the heat, and season with some salt and the lime juice. Taste, and add more salt or lime if needed. Set aside to keep warm."

Heat a griddle pan or grill until hot, and cook the chicken for 8-10 minutes on each side until cooked through and nicely charred."
