    "text": "Variations: This recipe yields very large taquitos. You can use smaller tortillas, but will need to reduce the amount of filling and cheese added to each. Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Reheat taquitos in a 350°F oven until warmed through, about 10 minutes."
