      "text": "Mix 1 cup of cold, cooked rice into the spaghetti bolognese sauce and stir it through. This will help to thicken the sauce as well as give it more bulk. I used brown rice but any rice is great. Remove the zucchini halves from the oven and fill them with cold, leftover spaghetti bolognese sauce. Top each half with a small handful of woolies Italian cheese mix. Bake in the oven at 180 for about 30 minutes or until the cheese is golden brown."
