Stir over a medium heat until the sugar melts and the ingredients start to combine into a sticky mixture (around 5 minutes). Then, use an immersion blender to blend into a smooth caramel. Alternatively, transfer to a blender or a food processor and pulse/blend on a low speed."

Use this time to melt the chocolate by putting it in a heatproof bowl over a saucepan of gently simmering water, making sure that the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Stir using a wooden spoon or a spatula until the chocolate is fully melted."
