  "description": "This recipe is meant as a rough guideline for making your own personal ranch dressing. I rarely measure and just add seasonings to taste. Start with the amounts listed and add more as needed. You can give it your own flair by adding other seasonings, such as dill weed, celery seed, or red pepper. Just start small because once you add it, you canâ€™t take it out!",
