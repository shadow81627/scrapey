    "2 teaspoons salt",
    "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",

Gradually add the stock about a cup at a time, stirring between each addition to work out any lumps. Then add the water all at once. It seems like a lot of liquid but don't worry. It's how it's supposed to be for now."

Be sure to add the coconut milk last as the other ingredients will drop the temperature a little and prevent it curdling."
