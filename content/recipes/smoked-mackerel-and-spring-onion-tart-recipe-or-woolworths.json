Trim away the excess, line the pastry shell with greaseproof paper, and fill with ceramic baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden. Remove the beans and paper, brush the bottom of the shell with a little of the egg wash, and return to the oven for 2-3 minutes to crisp. Remove from the oven, and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C."

Spoon evenly over the bottom of the pastry shell along with the remaining uncooked spring onion. Scatter over the mackerel, and season with plenty of black pepper."
