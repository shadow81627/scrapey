    "1 pinch salt",
    "1 pinch freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 clove garlic (peeled but left whole)",

    "2 tbs onion (finely chopped)",

      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Pour 2 tablespoons of the oil onto a baking tray, then gently press the bread into the oil on both sides. Season with salt and black pepper. Bake in the oven for 12-15 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oven, and lightly rub each slice of bread with the garlic. Set aside on a wire rack to keep the crostini crisp."

      "text": "Meanwhile, blanch the asparagus spears in lightly salted boiling water for 2-4 minutes. Drain, refresh in cold water, and drain again. Place on a board, and cut each spear in half lengthways. Heat the remaining oil in a heavy frying pan over a low heat, and cook the onion for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent. Add the halved asparagus spears, and cook further for 2 minutes. Preheat the grill to its highest setting."

      "text": "In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, and Parmesan. Season with salt and black pepper, and pour the mixture over the asparagus and onion mixture in the pan. As the bottom is cooking, tilt the pan so the uncooked egg mixture from the top spills over under the frittata. Continue cooking for 3-5 minutes until almost set. To finish off, place the pan under the grill, and grill until the top of the frittata is golden brown. To serve, tear the frittata into 4 rough pieces, and sit on top of the crostini. Scatter with parsley, and serve immediately."
