    "1 tablespoon olive oil, plus more for serving",
    "1 pound dried orzo",
    "Kosher salt",
    "4 1/4 cups water, divided",
    "1 pint grape tomatoes (about 2 cups), halved",
    "4 cups baby spinach (about 4 ounces)",
    "1 1/2 to 2 cups shredded, cooked chicken (from 1/2 rotisserie chicken)",

Add 1 pound orzo, season lightly with kosher salt, and cook, stirring constantly, until toasted, about 1 minute. Add 4 cups of the water and season with salt. Bring to a boil over high heat and cook, stirring occasionally to prevent sticking, until the orzo is al dente and most of the water is absorbed, about 7 minutes. Meanwhile, halve 1 pint grape tomatoes (about 2 cups)."

      "text": "Reduce the heat to medium and stir in the tomatoes, 4 cups baby spinach, 1 1/2 to 2 cups shredded chicken, 1 cup grated Parmesan cheese, and the remaining 1/4 cup water. Cook, stirring constantly, until the spinach is wilted, the chicken is warmed through, and the cheese is melted, about 2 minutes. A creamy, cheesy sauce should have formed, but If it looks dry at any point, add warm water a tablespoon at a time until you reach your desired consistency. Finish with a drizzle of olive oil and some freshly ground black pepper."
