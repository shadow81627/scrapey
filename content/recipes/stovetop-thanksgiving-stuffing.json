    "text": "Keep the stuffing warm for up to 30 minutes in the covered cooking pot. Alternately, transfer it to a crock pot on its &quot;warm&quot; setting for up to two hours, adding a splash of broth if it becomes a bit dry before serving.If you’re using homemade or low-sodium broth, add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Optional add-ins: Dried cranberries, chopped walnuts or pecans, toasted pine nuts, diced apples. Oven variation: You can easily convert this recipe to an oven-baked dressing. Instead of heating the broth, whisk in two eggs. Pour this mixture into the pot after you add the bread cubes, stir everything together, and pour the stuffing into a greased 9x13-inch baking dish. Bake at 375°F until heated through and browned on top, about 25 minutes."
