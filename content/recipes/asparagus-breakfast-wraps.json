    "4.5 oz swiss cheese ($0.92)",
    "3 medium roma tomatoes ($0.75)",
    "1 tsp butter ($0.02)",

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Place the washed and trimmed asparagus in a large skillet with about 1 cup of water (enough water so that the asparagus are half submerged when laying flat. See photos below). Bring the water up to a boil over medium/high heat. Simmer the asparagus until they are tender but not mushy and are still bright green (about 5-10 minutes). Use a fork to test their tenderness. If you have a lid for your skillet, use it to trap the steam and they will cook faster."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Pour off any excess water from the asparagus and season with 1 tsp of butter, a dash of salt, pepper and garlic powder. I just use a very light sprinkling of each, about a 1/4 tsp. Gently stir the asparagus to distribute the seasoning."

      "text": "While the asparagus are cooking, cook the egg to your liking (I fry to over-easy in a skillet with non-stick spray). Salt and pepper the egg if preferred."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Build the wrap by placing four asparagus in the center of the tortilla, then topping with.75 oz. of swiss, the cooked egg and 1/2 of a roma tomato, sliced. Fold both sides of the tortilla in toward the center, one side overlapping the other. Place the folded wrap back into the hot skillet where you cooked the egg, placing the folded side down. Cook the wrap until the tortilla is browned and crispy on both sides. This will also seal the wrap closed. Either serve whole or cut into two."
