The perfect quick dairy-free dressing for just about any salad!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/5-minute-smoky-chipotle-dressing/\n\nThe smoky, spicy flavor in this recipe comes from adobo sauce which typically consists of tomato, dried chiles, sweetener, salt, onion, vinegar, garlic, and dried herbs/spices. It originated in Spain where it was used as both a marinade and preservative. It’s believed that the sauce was then introduced in Mexico by Spanish explorers and enthusiastically adopted into Mexican cuisine.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
