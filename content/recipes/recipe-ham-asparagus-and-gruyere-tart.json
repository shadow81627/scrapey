  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Puff pastry: Look for ready-made puff pastry in the freezer section, particularly those brands made with all butter rather than oil. They will have a richer flavor, and the dough will produce nice layers of pastry. For best results, defrost in the refrigerator at least 4 hours and up to 1 day before using.Storage: This recipe is best eaten the day it&#x27;s made. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Rewarm in a 325°F oven until warmed through."

    "1/3 cup whole or 2% milk",
    "2 teaspoons Dijon mustard",
    "1/4 teaspoon kosher salt",

Halve lengthwise if the asparagus is thick; set aside. If your puff pastry is folded, let sit out at room temperature for about 15 minutes to soften slightly."

Unfold the puff onto the parchment (if your package has 2 sheets, place them side by side, slightly overlapping, so that they fit the baking sheet, and press together). Using a rolling pin, roll it into a rectangle about the size of the baking sheet. Transfer the puff, still on the parchment, to the baking sheet."

Poke the bottom of the crust with a fork so that the pastry doesn’t puff up. Bake until the edges puff and the top is a pale golden-brown, about 15 minutes.
