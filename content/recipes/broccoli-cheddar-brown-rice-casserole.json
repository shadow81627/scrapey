    "3 cups broccoli florets",
    "1/2 cup shredded carrots (optional)",
    "2 tablespoons butter",
    "1 small yellow onion (chopped)",
    "1 clove garlic (minced)",
    "2 tablespoons all-purpose flour",
    "2 cups milk (whole is best, but reduced fat will do)",
    "1 1/4 cup shredded extra-sharp cheddar cheese (divided)",
    "1/2 cup parmesan cheese",
    "1/2 teaspoon mustard powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon smoked paprika",
    "Salt and pepper to taste",

      "text": "Return the saucepan to medium-low heat. Once the saucepan is warm, add the butter and let it melt, then stir in the onions and garlic. Cook for about 7 minutes, or until the onions are softened and translucent. Sprinkle the flour over the onions and cook 2-3 minutes more, stirring constantly, until flour is golden brown. Slowly pour the milk into the saucepan, whisking to incorporate it into the flour as you pour. Take your time with this step! Once all the milk is in the saucepan, bring the mixture to a simmer, continuing to whisk constantly. Continue to cook, whisking often, until the sauce is thickened and coats the back of a wooden spoon (about 5 minutes more). Remove from heat and whisk in 1 cup of the cheddar cheese, the parmesan cheese, mustard powder, and paprika. Season to taste with salt and pepper."

Grease a square baking dish with butter or spray it with an oil mister (or cooking spray, if you don't have an oil mister); transfer the rice mixture to the baking dish and top with the remaining 1/4 cup of cheddar cheese and the panko. Spray the top of the casserole with additional oil and bake for 25 minutes, then broil for about 3 minutes more, until the panko is lightly browned. Remove from oven and let the casserole sit for about 5 minutes before serving."
