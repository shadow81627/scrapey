Add the sun-dried tomatoes, garlic, and red pepper flakes, and continue stirring until fragrant, 30 seconds. Stir in the spinach a handful at a time. Cook until the spinach is wilted. Taste the filling and add salt and pepper as needed. Transfer the filling to a bowl."

Pour half of the eggs into the pan. When the bottom has set, use a rubber spatula to lift the edges and allow the liquid eggs on top of the omelet to flow underneath. Continue cooking until the top is as set as you like them and the bottom is golden-brown."
