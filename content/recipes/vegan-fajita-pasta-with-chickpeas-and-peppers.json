    "description": "Vegan Fajita Pasta with Chickpeas/Beans and Veggies!\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/01/vegan-fajita-pasta-with-chickpeas.html\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡MY COOKBOOK: https://veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nA friend used to make a version of a chikin fajita pasta during undergrad. Just a simple fusion meal with pasta, cream, taco spice roasted things added in. For a vegan version I use chickpeas/beans and peppers. \n\nThe Veggies and Chickpeas are tossed in taco spice blend and crisped. The pasta is simmered in a cashew cream sauce with tomatoes and a few flavor ingredients. A portion of veggies and chickpeas is mixed in and the rest is used to top the dish when served. Add other veggies or beans of choice or some crisped tofu or vegan meat subs, soy curls, jackfruit etc. Dreamy, spicy and fun!\nVegan Soyfree. Can be Gluten-free. To make it nut-free use my Nut-free Alfredo https://www.veganricha.com/?s=alfredo\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\n\nâœ¦ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n\nMusic: DuDa by Gran Torino",
