Just 6 ingredients and 20 minutes required!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/easy-homemade-teriyaki-sauce-gluten-free/\n\nThe word “teriyaki” refers to a cooking technique developed by Japanese chefs in the 1700s. It involves broiling or grilling foods in a glaze made from soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. The following is not the traditional Japanese sauce, but an inspired version resembling the thick and sweet teriyaki sauce found in U.S. grocery stores and restaurants today.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
