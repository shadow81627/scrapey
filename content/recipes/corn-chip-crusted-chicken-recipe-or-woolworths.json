Pick up your chicken on the thickest part with the fork and dunk it into the flour, than dust off excess flour and dunk it into the egg mixture, drain the excess and then drop it into your crumbing mixture. I use a spoon to poor the mixture on the top of the mixture then flip it over and ensure all of the fillet is covered with seasoning/crumb. Place on the floured tray and repeat until finished all the chicken fillets."

Once the oil is heated I turn it down to med-low heat this ensures that the chicken cooks properly and the crumbling doesn't crisp up and burn quickly. If you find it's cooking very slow and not changing colour increase the heat but don't ever cook them on the highest heat."
