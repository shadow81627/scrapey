Spray a baking sheet and coat all sides of the poblano peppers with non-stick spray (you can rub olive oil all over them but I find spraying is much easier). Place the baking sheet a few inches under the broiler (I use the second rack level) and broil on each side for 5 minutes."

Remove them from the bag and peel away as much of the skin as possible (be gentle and it is okay if you canâ€™t get ALL of the skin)."
