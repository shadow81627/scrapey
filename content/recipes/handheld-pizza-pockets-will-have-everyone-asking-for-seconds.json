    "text": "Make ahead: Freeze the unbaked pizza pockets in a single layer on the baking sheet until solid. Transfer to a zip-top bag and freeze for up to 3 months. To cook pizza pockets from frozen, bake at 425°F for 30 minutes, or until the filling reaches 160°F.Storage: The baked pizza pockets can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw in the refrigerator before reheating in a low oven or in the microwave in 1-minute bursts on HIGH, 2 to 3 minutes total. The pizza pockets won’t be as crisp when reheated in the microwave."
