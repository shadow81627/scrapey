  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 1/2 lb (680 grams) raw sweet potatoes (, or 2 packed cups of already cooked & mashed sweet potato)",
    "1/2 to 3/4 cup (43 to 65 grams) unsweetened cocoa powder (, add to taste)",
    "1/2 cup (120 ml) maple syrup",
    "2 tablespoons nut/seed butter (, add a little more for a pronounced nut flavour (use tahini or seed butter to keep nut-free)",
    "2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
    "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt",
    "OPTIONAL up to 3/4 cup (180 mls) plant milk (the pudding is thick & fudgy without any milk)"

      "text": "First cook the sweet potato. Roast, steam or microwave. I don't recommend boiling it because it gets too watery. You can do this part up to 3 days in advance then store the cooked potato in the fridge. To roast (my preferred method for best flavour) - Preheat oven to 425°F (220°C). Cut each potato in half lengthways and roast cut side down on a baking tray lined with a silicone baking mat or lightly oiled parchment paper. Time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes but allow roughly 30 minutes. To microwave - Pierce potatoes a few times with a fork. Cook in the microwave on full powder until soft. Time will vary depending on the size of the potatoes. Usually 5 to 7 minutes. To steam - Peel potatoes and cube. Place in a steamer basket and steam until tender. About 10 minutes."

      "text": "Add the other ingredients and blend until smooth, light and airy. Start with the smaller amount of cocoa powder, blend it all up then taste and add more, blending after each addition, as necessary. I like to add the max amount for a nice rich, dark chocolate flavour. The pudding will thicken quite a bit in the fridge to an almost fudgy texture. Feel free to add up to 3/4 cup of plant milk if you prefer a looser pudding."
