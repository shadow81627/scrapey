  "description": "These are hands down the best vegan chocolate chip cookies you will ever make! They are crispy on the outside, and perfectly chewy! They are sweet (but not too sweet), buttery, and oozing with melty chocolate. These cookies are easy to make, use only 1 bowl and 10 ingredients, and will stay chewy for days when kept at room temperature or freeze wonderfully as well. Recipe adapted from Fuss-Free Vegan.",

      "text": "Take about 2 tablespoons of cookie dough (I used a cookie scoop), and place the ball of dough on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat, giving each cookie room to spread making about 18 cookies. Do not flatten the cookies. Bake 12 - 15 minutes until the edges are just beginning to brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the pan. The cookies will be puffy when you first remove them from the oven but will flatten more as they cool. They will also get chewier as they cool, and will become super chewy when left overnight uncovered at room temperature."
