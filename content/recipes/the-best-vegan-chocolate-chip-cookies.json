      "text": "Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Form the dough into balls, any size you like, and place on a baking sheet. Bake cookies until the bottom is just browned but the top still looks a little bit underdone (they will finished cooking as they cool and this will ensure that they are gooey on the inside). Cookies will take about 10-20 minutes total, depending on how big you make them. I like to take the cookies out after about 10 minutes and bang the cookie tray on the top of the oven so that they aren’t quite as thick. Sometimes I do that a few times during the cooking process."
