I dont roast the eggplant completely like my mom does, because then the gas burner becomes very messy. The eggplant starts to drip once the skin gets charred and open. I usually put a foil and some water in the burner base to help with the cleaning later. The burner top though, you cant save:). I just char the skin to get the roasted taste in the eggplant."
