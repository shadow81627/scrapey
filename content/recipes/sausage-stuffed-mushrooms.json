    "4 tablespoons olive oil, divided",

    "1 pound uncooked mild Italian sausage",

    "2 large garlic cloves, pressed or finely minced",
    "1/4 cup dry sherry, marsala, vermouth, or white wine (I used sherry)",
    "1 large egg",
    "1/2 cup breadcrumbs",
    "1/2 cup grated Parmesan, plus more for serving",
    "1/4 cup heavy cream",
    "1/4 cup packed finely minced Italian parsley, divided",

Remove any casings from the sausage, add to the skillet, cook until golden brown, 8 to 10 minutes, using a wooden spoon to crumble into small pieces. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the sausage to a large mixing bowl. Do not drain the fat from the skillet."

Season filling generously with salt, freshly ground pepper, and red pepper flakes if using. You want the mixture to be a little saltier than you think necessary, because the mushroom caps will mellow out the flavor."

Flip them so the well-side is facing up and stuff each one with a generous amount of filling using a spoon. Bake the mushrooms for 22 to 25 minutes, until hot and golden. Transfer to a serving platter and garnish with the remaining parsley and additional Parmesan. Serve while warm."
