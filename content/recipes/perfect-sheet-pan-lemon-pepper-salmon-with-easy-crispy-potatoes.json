Slice the white and light green parts crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces and add to the baking sheet. Drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, season with 3/4 teaspoon of the kosher salt and 1/4 teaspoon of the black pepper, and toss to coat.

An instant-read thermometer into the middle of the thickest fillet should register 120 to 130°F for medium-rare or 135 to 145°F if you prefer it more well-done. Garnish with the parsley, more freshly ground black pepper if desired, and serve with the lemon wedges."
