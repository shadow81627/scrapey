Roll up halfway, then fold in sides and complete rolling to the end. Do not roll too tightly as this will cause the pastry to split during baking. Transfer to prepared tray and brush with butter. Using the point of a small sharp knife, make 4 small incisions in the top to allow the steam to escape."
