  "description": "These moist bars will work with any juicy fruit, so feel free to substitute if you don’t have peaches. Add stevia to taste or leave it out if you like your bars less sweet. If gluten is a concern, make sure your oats are certified gluten-free or perhaps experiment with quinoa flakes.",
