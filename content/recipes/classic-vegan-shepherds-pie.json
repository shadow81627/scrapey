Add cubed potatoes and boil until soft, about 15 minutes. Time will depend on how large your pieces are. Potatoes are done when they are easily pierced with a fork. Drain the water through a colander and rinse under cold water until the potatoes have cooled enough to handle. Lightly mash the potatoes with a potato masher. Once most of the big chunks have broken down, add the remaining ingredients and mix together until well incorporated and the potatoes are light and fluffy. Set aside."

Add the lentils, vegetable broth, and tomato paste. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cover. Cook for 30-40 minutes until the lentils are cooked all the way through and all the liquid has absorbed. Stir in the peas."
