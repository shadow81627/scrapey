  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "For savory oatmeal ideas: omit the cinnamon and dried fruit. Stir in up to 1 cup total of ingredients like grated cheese, roasted vegetables, sautéed mushrooms. You can also add flavorings such as miso paste, dried herbs and spices.For other sweet oatmeal ideas: push fresh or frozen fruit (berries or cubed larger fruits are best) or chocolate chips into each oatmeal cup before baking. Replace the liquid with brewed chai tea or add other sweet spices such as cardamom for a different flavor.If you have a sweet tooth, stir 1 tablespoon of your desired sweetener into the batter."
