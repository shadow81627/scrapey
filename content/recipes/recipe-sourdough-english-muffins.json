    "text": "Sourdough starter: Get some starter from a friend or the mail or a class, or follow instructions on starting a starter from scratch. I keep a very small amount going all the time so I can use the active material that other bakers might consider discard. Twice a day I skim and feed: remove a tablespoon for baking, or storing in the refrigerator for future projects. Then I feed the jar I keep on the counter a tablespoon of all-purpose flour and a tablespoon of water, stir it with a knife and place a lid on top of the jar, not screwing it in place.For the weekend baker: You can stow your sourdough starter in the fridge all week and take out the jar Thursday night. Feed it a tablespoon each of flour and water. Friday morning, discard half the starter, which should be bubbling and coming back to life. Feed another tablespoon of flour and water, and by Friday evening, you can start the recipe.Flour: While I&#x27;m a whole-grain enthusiast, sourdough likes to eat endosperm, the starches that make up a grain kernel, more than bran. So I use sifted flour to keep a lively leavener.Storage: The cooled English muffins can be stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days or frozen for up to 3 months."
