    "text": "Using just all-purpose flour: You can use all all-purpose flour if you don&#x27;t have any cake flour on hand (pastry flour would also be great.)Maple syrup substitutes: You can substitute honey or corn syrup for the maple syrup, although in my opinion, the flavors isn&#x27;t nearly as delicious.Storage: Store the bars in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days."
