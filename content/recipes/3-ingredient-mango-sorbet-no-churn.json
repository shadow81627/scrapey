Mix again until food processor begins to run smoothly, scraping down the sides as needed. Once there are very few mango pieces visible, leave the processor on for at least 1 minute to achieve the creamiest consistency possible!"

If freezing for more than a few hours, remove and thaw for about 10-15 minutes for easy scooping. Keeps in the freezer for up to 2 weeks!"
