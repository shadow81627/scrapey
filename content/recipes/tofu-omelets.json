Using a spatula, spread the batter out into an even circle, covering the bottom of the pan. Cook the omelette until the top is dry, about 4 minutes. With the spatula, gently loosen the edges of the omelette from the pan and turn the heat down to medium low. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the grated cheese and 1/4 of the vegetable mixture over the bottom half of the omelette and flip the top half over the filling. (Note: The top half will not completely cover your filling, and that’s okay.)"
