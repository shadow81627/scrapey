Bring saucepan back to the stove and cook the cream at medium-low heat, whisking constantly, until it thickens (this will happen quickly, in 30 to 45 seconds). Turn off heat and add 1/2 tablespoon of coconut oil, mixing well until it melts completely. Set aside to cool, but do not refrigerate. Cover the surface with plastic wrap (so it touches the cream)"
