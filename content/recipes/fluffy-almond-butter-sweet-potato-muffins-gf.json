    "1 cup sweet potato purée (~1 large sweet potato, as recipe is written)",
    "1/3 cup maple syrup",
    "1/4 cup salted creamy almond butter",
    "1 large egg (or sub 1 batch flax egg per egg — though we haven’t tested it that way)",
    "2/3 cup unsweetened almond milk or cashew milk",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking powder",
    "2 tsp pumpkin pie spice",
    "1/2 cup gluten-free flour blend",
    "2/3 cup almond flour",

Place on parchment-lined baking sheet and bake at 375 F (190 C) for ~25-30 minutes or until tender to the touch. Let cool for 5 minutes. Then peel away skin and mash in a mixing bowl (or food processor). Set aside."
