    "text": "Make ahead: You can dry out the bread the day before and leave it in the oven (turned off) overnight. The vegetables can be cooked up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container. Do not mix the stuffing beforehand or it’ll get too soggy.Storing: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Reheat in a 350ºF oven until warmed through."
