      "text": "Divide among serving bowls. Tip 1: It is essential to cook the chicken in batches so that it does not overcrowd the pan and start to stew in its own juices. Tip 2: If you donâ€™t have a wok you can use a large deep frying pan set over the largest burner on your stove top. Tip 3: Swap the noodles for a 450g packet of 90 Second microwavable rice."
