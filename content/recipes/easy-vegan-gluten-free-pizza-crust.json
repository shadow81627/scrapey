    "1 1/3 cup almond flour (not almond meal // I prefer Wellbee's brand)",

    "1/2 cup arrowroot starch",
    "1 Tbsp flaxseed meal",
    "1 tsp baking soda",
    "1 tsp oregano",
    "1/2 tsp garlic powder",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1 Tbsp apple cider vinegar",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil (if oil-free, try subbing water)",
    "7-8 Tbsp water (add more as needed)",
    "Easy Marinara (or store-bought pizza sauce or puréed tomatoes)",
    "Vegan Pesto",
    "Sliced vegetables (e.g. bell pepper, onion, mushroom, kalamata olives)",
    "Whipped Almond Ricotta",
    "Fresh basil",
    "Red pepper flake",

(You won't be cooking the pizza on the pan but rather on the parchment paper placed directly on the oven rack. So if you don't have a pizza pan, don't worry. You just need something to hold and transfer the pizza in and out of the oven.)"

It should be about 1/4-inch thick or less. It will puff up a little when baking. If the dough sticks to your hands, lightly oil to prevent sticking."
