Mix until all the flour is combined and you have a sticky dough, making sure you get right into the bottom of the bowl. Then cover with cling wrap.If you wish to leave the dough overnight or all day before baking, put it in the fridge and leave it there for anything between 8 - 10 hours.If you want to make the speedier version, you can put the bowl on the stove top or next to it and set the oven on low so that the residual heat kicks the yeast into action (make sure it isn't in direct contact with the heat though. There should just be gentle warmth. Anything more could kill the yeast). If you do this it will need to be left for 2 hours (although up to 3 will be fine). If you just leave it on the kitchen counter with no warmth from the oven you should leave it for anything between 3 1/2 -4 1/2 hours."
