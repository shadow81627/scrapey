    "1 egg, lightly beaten, for egg wash",
    "3 tbs tomato passata",

      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C (Gas 6). Roll out the pastry, and lay on a baking tray. Using a sharp knife, score a line about 5cm in from the edges all the way around to form a border, but do not cut all the way through the pastry. Next, using the back of the knife, score the pastry all the way around the outer edges. This helps it to puff up when cooking."

      "text": "Brush the border with the egg wash, then smooth the passata over the inside area right to the scored edges. Arrange the anchovies and olives over the tart so that everyone gets a taste of each, and sprinkle over a pinch of black pepper."
