    "1 1/2 ounce vodka",
    "1 cup of unsweetened plant milk (SEE NOTE)",

When the oil is hot (add a piece of onion, if it sizzles, it’s ready) add the onion and stir to coat and spread evenly in the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and stir often to caramelize. This will take approximately 15 minutes. The onions will slowly brown to a beautiful amber color."

Simmer for 10 minutes or longer if you want to cook off more of the alcohol. If you need to cook off all of the alcohol, simmer at the lowest temperature for 3 hours, stirring frequently to avoid scorching the sauce. You may need to add more milk if it becomes too thick."
