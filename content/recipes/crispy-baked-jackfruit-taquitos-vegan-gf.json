  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 (20-ounce) cans jackfruit in water or brine (NOT in syrup // we like Trader Joe’s brand)",
    "2 Tbsp avocado or coconut oil (if avoiding oil, sub water)",
    "1/2 large white or yellow onion (thinly sliced)",
    "4 cloves garlic, minced (optional)",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1 Tbsp ground smoked paprika",
    "1 Tbsp ground cumin",
    "1 Tbsp chili powder",
    "2-3 Tbsp coconut sugar (or maple syrup or organic brown sugar)",
    "1-2 small chipotle peppers in adobo sauce (from a can* // roughly chopped)",
    "3 tsp adobo sauce (use more or less to achieve preferred spice level)",
    "3-4 Tbsp coconut aminos",
    "2/3 cup water (plus more as needed)",
    "2 Tbsp lime juice (optional as some tanginess comes from the jackfruit brine)",
    "16 corn tortillas",
    "Avocado oil (for greasing pan and brushing taquitos)",
    "Refried beans",
    "Guacamole",
    "Vegan sour cream",
    "Salsa verde"

      "text": "Thoroughly rinse and drain jackfruit. Then begin sorting. The pieces come in chunks or triangle shapes. Cut off the center “core” portion of the jackfruit that’s tougher in texture and separate it from the rest of the fruit. Then chop into smaller pieces. For the remaining portion of the jackfruit that appears more stringy, use your hands or a fork to pull into small shredded pieces. You’re basically trying to get the jackfruit into small, shredded/chopped pieces. Rinse the jackfruit once more in a fine mesh strainer, drain, and thoroughly dry."

      "text": "Next, working in batches (~8 tortillas at a time), warm your tortillas by wrapping them in a damp kitchen towel or paper towel and microwaving for ~30-60 seconds. This ensures they are nice and pliable to prevent them from splitting open or unfolding."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Fill the tortillas one at a time, using ~2 heaping tablespoons of the jackfruit mixture. They hold their shape best if you place the filling closer to one side and in a narrow pile (see photo). Roll gently but tightly into taquitos and place them seam side down on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat until all the filling is used. It should make ~16 taquitos."
