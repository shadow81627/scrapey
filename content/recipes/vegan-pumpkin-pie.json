      "text": "If your pie crust isn't already blind-baked (partially baked) do that now. Here's how:Preheat oven to 400°F (200 °C) with a large metal baking tray in there as it preheats. Prick the bottom of the pie crust all over with a fork then carefully line with parchment paper. Fill with baking beans, dried beans or dried rice and put on the preheated tray in the oven. Bake for about 17 minutes or until the edges of the crust are just beginning to turn a very gentle golden brown. Remove from the oven and gently lift out the parchment paper along with the baking beans/rice. Then return to the oven and bake for another 7 minutes, or until the bottom of the crust is just beginning to turn a gentle golden brown. Remove from the oven and turn the oven down to 350 °F. It's ok if the crust is warm when you add the filling.If using a store bought pie crust follow the directions on the box."
