The sauce and ranch looks like a lot of ingredients, but they are mainly cashew cream, divided into 2 bowls, spiced up and used as  White Garlic sauce and Vegan Ranch. Make it once and the second time it will be a breeze! \nBuffalo sauce + Ranch + chickpeas = heaven.\nMake this Buffalo Chickpea Pizza!",
