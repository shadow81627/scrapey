If using our Instant Pot Chickpeas or another method from scratch, you likely won’t need much more seasoning. In either case, taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more garlic for zing, lemon for acidity, harissa for heat, maple syrup to balance the heat, paprika for smokiness, or olive oil for creaminess or herbal, peppery flavor."

Marinated chickpeas will keep covered in the refrigerator for up to 1 week (depending on freshness of ingredients). We haven’t tried freezing them but suspect that they would be fine for up to 1 month."
