    "1 cup fresh basil (packed)",
    "2 tablespoons nutritional yeast",

    "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)",

      "text": "Cook the spaghetti squash. You can bake it, microwave it, or do as I did and pressure cook it. To pressure cook, cut the squash in half and scoop out the seeds. Place a steamer basket in your pressure cooker, add 1 cup of water, and place the squash halves in the basket. Seal pressure cooker and cook at high pressure for 8 minutes. Release pressure, uncover, and allow the squash to cool until you can handle it comfortably."

Cook, stirring every 60 seconds, until the mushrooms soften and exude their juices, about 3 minutes. Uncover and cook until most of the liquid evaporates. Season lightly with salt and pepper, if you like, and set aside."
