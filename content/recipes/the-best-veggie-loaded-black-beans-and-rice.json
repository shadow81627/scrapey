When the oil/broth is hot, add the onion, bell pepper, and jalapeno and sauté until tender, approximately 5 to 7 minutes. Stir frequently. Pour the 1 and 1/2 cups of vegetable broth (or water if you're not using broth) over the vegetables and bring to a boil. When the broth is boiling stir in the rice, cover, and reduce the heat to simmer for the amount of time directed on the package. Usually 20 minutes."
