Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding more lemon juice for acidity, salt + pepper for flavor balance, or maple syrup for sweetness. Garlic will add more bite/spice."

Toast/brown, stirring frequently, until the natural oils begin to release and they turn light brown and become fragrant. Then transfer to the food processor. To the still warm skillet add the coriander seed and toast until some of the seeds begin to pop and they are fragrant. Move off the heat and smash with a pestle or wooden spoon. Then add to food processor along with ground cumin, pepper and sea salt, cinnamon and coconut sugar (optional). Process to combine. Set aside. Store completely cooled leftovers in a sealed container at room temperature up to 3 weeks, though best in the first two weeks."
