Let the cake cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then invert it onto a rack to cool completely. Double the ingredients for the glaze, too.CUPCAKES: Bake in a cupcake tin lined with paper liners, filling them no more than halfway full, until puffed and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 12 to 18 minutes. Makes 12 to 18 cupcakes.LOAF: Bake in a 9 x 5 x 3-inch loaf pan until puffed and a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean, 55 to 65 minutes. You’ll need a half batch of glaze to coat the cake in a thin layer.ROUND: Bake in a 9-inch round pan until puffed and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 45 minutes.Reprinted with permission from Snacking Cakes: Simple Treats for Anytime Baking by Yossy Arefi, 2020.
