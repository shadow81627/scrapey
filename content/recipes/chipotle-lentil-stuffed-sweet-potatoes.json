      "text": "While sweet potatoes bake, prepare the filling. Coat the bottom of a medium saucepan with oil and place over medium heat. Add onion and sauté until soft and translucent, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and sauté 1 minute more, until very fragrant. Add broth and lentils. Raise heat and bring to a simmer. Lower heat and allow to simmer, uncovered, until lentils are almost fully cooked, but just a bit firm and most of the broth has evaporated, about 30-35 minutes. You can add a bit of water during cooking if too much of the liquid evaporates."

Lower heat and allow to simmer, stirring occasionally, until lentils are fully cooked, sauce is thick, and kale is tender, about 10 minutes more. Add up to 1/2 cup of water during simmering if the sauce becomes too thick."
