Put the chocolate and butter into a microwave dish and heat for 1 minute. Give it a stir, and if needed put on for a little longer, but only in 10 second increments, as you only want to melt it, not burn it otherwise it will go grainy and the whole thing won't be as nice. It should look super smooth and shiny once mixed."

I grease with a little butter. My favourite is mini muffin pans, which are 4cm in diameter. Fill to the top, as they do not rise. I also occasionally use 7cm diameter regular muffin pans. And of course you can make one big brownie in a 22cm cake pan, but then you have everyone wanting an edge piece."

When cooked they should have a slightly shiny top with a few cracks around the edges, and when poked with a knife there shouldn't be much left sticking to the knife, although a little should stick as you don't want a dry centre."
