  "description": "Homemade Sabich will make you feel like youâ€™re having breakfast in Israel! The ingredients in this Israeli recipe are simple. Sabich is made with fried eggplant, hummus, tomato and cucumber salad, tahini sauce, Israeli pickles, and a 6-minute egg, all stuffed into a pita pocket. Amba is optional, at least in our opinion!",
