      "text": "If you decide to use the avocado, which we highly recommend, take 1 cup of the finished salsa (the recipe makes 3 1/2 cups, so about a third) and put it in a separate bowl. Take one cup of the tomatillo salsa, add a mashed avocado, 2-3 teaspoons of freshly squeezed lemon, and a pinch of salt to taste, mix well and serve. The avocado will make this salsa really creamy and delicious and as a bonus the avocado will not turn brown!"
