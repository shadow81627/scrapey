    "1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (chopped)",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp ground cumin",
    "1/2 tsp turmeric",
    "1 1/4 - 1 1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper (or sub a pinch of cayenne)",
    "1-3 Tbsp tahini (ground sesame seeds)",
    "Olive, grape seed or coconut oil for cooking",

Then add the rest of the chickpeas and blend until you have a dough that's close to a paste in consistency. This may take up to 4-5 minutes to fully incorporate all of the spices and herbs.

Once hot, add enough oil to create a thin layer on the bottom of the pan and wait 1-2 minutes for the oil to heat up. Then place only as many burgers as will fit comfortably in the pan and cook 2-3 minutes on each side. Once the bottom side is evenly browned, flip gently, as they can be fragile. Continue until all burgers are cooked. Adjust heat as needed if they're browning too quickly, or aren't cooking quickly enough."
