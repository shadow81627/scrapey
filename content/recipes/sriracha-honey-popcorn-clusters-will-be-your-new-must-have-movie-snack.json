When the kernels pop, add the remaining kernels to the pan, shake to coat with oil, and cover. Pop the corn, shaking the pan occasionally, until the popping slows.

If the popcorn cools too much and won’t stick, put the sheets back in the oven for a few minutes until the popcorn is warm again. (The popcorn can also be cooled as is, without clustering, and eaten by the handful like regular popcorn.) Let the clusters cool completely."
