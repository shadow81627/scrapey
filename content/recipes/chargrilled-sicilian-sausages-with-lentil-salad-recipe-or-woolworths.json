In a small bowl or jug, whisk together the extra 3 tablespoons of olive oil and the lemon juice to make a dressing. Pour over the lentil salad, and stir thoroughly. To serve, put the sausage coil on a large round platter, remove the skewers, and separate the links with kitchen scissors or a sharp knife. Serve at the table with the lentil salad, so that everyone can help themselves."
