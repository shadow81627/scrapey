  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Storage: Leftover pizza can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. Reheat slices in a 350ºF oven, on the stovetop, or in an air fryer. Make ahead: Freeze the assembled, unbaked pizza on a baking sheet until frozen solid. Wrap the pizza tightly with plastic wrap, then aluminum foil. Freeze for up to 1 month. When ready to bake, unwrap the pizza and bake from frozen on a preheated pan or baking sheet until golden-brown and the cheese is melted, about 15 minutes."
