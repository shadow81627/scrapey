      "text": "Place the chickpeas, olive oil, lemon juice, tahini, and garlic into the bowl of a food processor fitted with an S-blade. Blend until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. You can thin the mixture with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water if needed, but you'll want to keep it relatively think so it works to bind the sandwich. Add in the sun-dried tomatoes and pulse until they're finely chopped. Season with salt to taste."
