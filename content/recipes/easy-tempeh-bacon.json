  "recipeIngredient": [
    "8 ounces tempeh (ensure gluten-free as needed)",
    "1 Tbsp oil (avocado oil // if oil-free, omit or add slightly more tamari and maple syrup)",
    "3 Tbsp tamari (or coconut aminos if soy-free, just use a bit more as it’s not as salty as tamari)",
    "2 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "1 healthy pinch sea salt",
    "1 1/2 tsp liquid smoke",
    "1 1/2 tsp smoked paprika",
    "1/2 tsp ground black pepper (plus more for coating)",
    "1 dash cayenne (optional // omit for less heat)"

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Slice the tempeh in half widthwise (so you have 2 even squares), then thinly slice each square in thirds so you have six very thin squares (it’s easiest to do this by placing the tempeh flat on your cutting board and holding the knife horizontally for an even cut). Then slice each square into three rectangular strips. You should have ~18 pieces of tempeh (as the original recipe is written)."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "In a shallow bowl, rimmed plate, or baking dish, whisk together the oil, tamari, maple syrup, salt, liquid smoke, smoked paprika, black pepper, and cayenne (optional). Taste and adjust flavor as needed. It should be quite salty, smoky, a little spicy, and plenty sweet (even a little too sweet, as it needs to balance the bitterness of the tempeh)."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add the tempeh and toss to coat (using a pastry brush is helpful for fully coating). Marinate for 10-15 minutes, flipping once for even flavor dispersion."
