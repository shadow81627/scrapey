      "text": "In a small skillet, fry the egg. I really like runny yolks, especially in this quesadilla because of the way the yolk mixes with the creamed spinach and melted cheese. To accomplish this, make sure your skillet is nice and hot before adding the egg. Fry it on one side until the whites are mostly set and the yolk is still runny. Briefly flip the egg over and fry for 30 seconds or so. This will finish setting the top of the whites and create a skin on top of the yolk leaving the inside still runny! YUM!"
