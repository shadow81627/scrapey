This should take about 10 minutes, but check the pasta package for recommended cooking times and aim for the lower end if a range is given. (The macaroni will continue to cook a bit in the sauce.) When the macaroni is ready, biting into a piece should reveal a very thin core of uncooked pasta."

Add the cheese in three batches, stirring frequently as each batch is added and waiting until the cheese has melted before adding the next batch.
