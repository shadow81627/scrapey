  "description": "As mentioned above, these were difficult to remove from the pan even though I sprayed it with pure canola oil. Perhaps a commercial non-stick spray would work better. Obviously, I don't recommend trying these without oiling unless you have a silicone pan. Better yet, make them as muffins!",

Be careful to dip the donut very briefly or it will absorb too much of the glaze. Allow to dry before serving."
