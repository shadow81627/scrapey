  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1-2 Tbsp nutritional yeast (add more for a more intense “cheese” flavor)",
    "1/2 tsp garlic powder",
    "3/4-1 tsp sea salt (use lesser end of range, if desired, as they’re pretty cheesy/savory)",
    "2/3 cup unbleached all-purpose flour or whole-wheat pastry flour*",
    "1/4 cup oat flour (or just sub more all-purpose)",
    "3 Tbsp yellow cornmeal",
    "1/4 tsp baking powder (optional // for fluffiness)",
    "3 Tbsp olive oil or vegan butter (such as Earth Balance // I did a 1/2-1/2 mix of both)",
    "2-4 Tbsp cold water"

Use a knife, pizza cutter or small cut cookie cutter shape to cut the dough into square crackers. Optional: dot the centers with a fork prong or chopstick for more character/resemblance to a Cheez-It."
