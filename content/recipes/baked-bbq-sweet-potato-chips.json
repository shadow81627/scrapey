Place the sweet potato slices into a large bowl and drizzle with olive oil (about 3-4 teaspoons, more if needed) and sprinkle with BBQ seasoning. Toss until all sweet potato slices are coated with olive oil and seasoning."

      "text": "Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Place sweet potatoes on the tray making sure that they donâ€™t overlap. You will need to bake sweet potato chips in batches. Bake 20-30 minutes, flipping chips once, until crispy. Let cool for 5-10 minutes and they will harden up a little bit more."
