    "1/8 tsp ground cumin",

Add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) avocado oil and place half of your tofu mixture into the skillet (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Distribute the tofu mixture evenly over the pan so it’s in one thin layer. Cook for 3-4 minutes, undisturbed. It should be sizzling and popping slightly — if it’s not, turn up the heat a bit."

If you prefer sausage “patties” you can scoop the tofu before cooking and press into 2-inch rounds and freeze to cook later."
