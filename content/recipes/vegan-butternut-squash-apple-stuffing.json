Toss well, so the squash, apples and onion are well coated with the olive oil, syrup and spices. Transfer it to the same lined baking sheet you used for the bread, in a single layer (if your baking sheet isn't large enough, use two of them). Bake for 30 minutes, until the vegetables and apples are tender, but not mushy"
