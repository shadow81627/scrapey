Tip 1: If your soup is over-heated the milk will curdle. You can add 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda with the milk to prevent curdling. Tip 2: For a spicy soup, add 1 coarsely chopped long red chilli or 1/2 teaspoon dried chilli flakes with the tomato paste. Omit milk and serve with a dollop of sour cream. Tip 3: Swap shells for short angel hair pasta. Swap capsicum for zucchini."
