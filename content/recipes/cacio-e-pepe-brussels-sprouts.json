  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: This dish is best eaten the day it’s made. However, you can make the sauce up to 2 days in advance and refrigerate in an airtight container. Reheat in the microwave in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until fully melted.Cheese grating: I like using a food processor the best to finely grate the cheese, but if you don’t have one, use the smallest holes on a box grater or a Microplane to grate the cheeses.Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 5 days."
