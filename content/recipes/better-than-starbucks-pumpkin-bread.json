    "description": "Sure, a warm Spinach, Feta, and Egg White wrap hits the spot when I'm hungry and in a rush. And I have a soft spot for the trio of cake-y Petite Vanilla Bean Scones, which my mom used to pick up for me whenever she stopped for an extra-hot latte on her way home from work. But the very best thing from Starbucks' bakery case is their Pumpkin Bread. It doesn't matter whether I'm buying it at 6 a.m. from the Cincinnati mall as a pick-me-up during Black Friday shopping, if I'm treating myself on a Saturday afternoon at the location near me in Brooklyn, or if I'm grabbing a piece at the airport before boarding a flight. The thick slice is always reliably soft, moist, and tender; every time I never think I'll be able to finish it, and every time there's not a single crumb left in sight. The only thing better than sitting down to a slice of pumpkin bread at Starbucks is whipping up an even better loaf in my kitchen. This homemade version is much more cost effective, fills my house with the most delicious scents of pumpkin and cinnamon (far better than any pumpkin spice candle), and means I can have a slice whenever I please.",
