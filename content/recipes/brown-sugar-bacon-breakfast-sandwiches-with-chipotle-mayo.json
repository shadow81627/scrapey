Sprinkle the brown sugar over the bacon and pat it into the surface lightly. Bake the bacon in the preheated oven until brown and crispy. (About 10 minutes for regular bacon or 20 minutes for thick cut bacon. Watch the bacon closely as every oven is different.)"

Cover the mayo and refrigerate until ready to use. Slice the tomato into thick rounds. Wash and shake dry the lettuce. Slice the buns in half."

Spread a tablespoon of the chipotle mayo on each side of the bun, add a lettuce leaf or two, a slice of tomato, an egg, and one slice of bacon (broken into two short strips). Enjoy!"
