    "description": "There's a reason why many steakhouses and chain restaurants have warm spinach-artichoke dip on their appetizer menu. With a tangy, creamy base fragrant with Parmesan cheese and onions, swirled through with spinach and tender artichoke hearts, this comforting dip — just begging to be scooped up with crackers or a piece of French bread — screams approachable decadence. What sets this dip apart from other versions is the addition of lemon zest at the end. It helps to cut through all the richness of the dairy and give it a bit of fresh zing.",
