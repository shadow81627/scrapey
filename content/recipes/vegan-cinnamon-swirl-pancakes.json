Cut one of the corners of the ziploc bag or the tip of the pastry bag with the cinnamon swirl mixture in it and make a concentric circle on each pancake, starting from the center and swirling outward. When small bubbles start to form and pop on the edge of the pancakes, about 2-3 minutes, flip them and cook on the opposite side for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown and cooked through. Repeat with remaining batter. Serve topped with a drizzle of maple syrup."
