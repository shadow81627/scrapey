Scoop the batter with a 1/4-cup measuring cup into the skillet, making 2 to 3 pancakes at a time. Cook until the bottoms are golden-brown, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the pancakes and cook until the second side is golden-brown, about 3 minutes more. Transfer to a serving plate and repeat with the remaining batter. Serve with fried eggs, more avocado, pico de gallo, sour cream, and/or hot sauce if desired."
