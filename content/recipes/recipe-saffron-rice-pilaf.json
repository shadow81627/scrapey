  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "You can make various kinds of pulao rice dishes using this method for saffron rice. Vegetables would go in just after the spices, and get cooked for a couple of minutes before adding rice. Add a teaspoon of garam masala to the vegetables, and let the spice mix cook out for an extra burst of flavor.You can also make a sweet version of this pulao (a traditional Mangalorean/ Goan version), which goes brilliantly with spicy food. Instead of adding the salt, add 1 1/2 tablespoons sugar plus a pinch of salt to the rice. Leave out the saffron, and stir in sweet, caramelized onions, toasted cashews and lightly fried raisins at the end. Use ghee for the best flavor."
