You can dip and add a few more bread slices to the skillet if there's room, but avoid crowding the skillet, and work in as many batches as are needed. Cook each piece for about 4 minutes on each side, until lightly browned, then transfer them to a plate. Add a bit of oil to the skillet between batches to prevent sticking."
