      "text": "Add some oil to a wok and heat on high heat. Add tofu cubes (be careful as it does splatter!) and let it cook without stirring for about 3min. Then stir occasionally. You want to create a bit of a \"burned\" outside so that it gets crispy and sticky. The great thing about tofu is that you can't undercook it, and from my experience it hardly ever burns or overcooks! So just keep going until it's browned and a bit crispy looking."
