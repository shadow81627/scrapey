    "1 small sized zucchini",
    "1/2 cup chopped mushrooms (caps only (see note)",
    "1/4 cup sundried tomatoes (dry or in water, not oil)",
    "2 tablespoons fresh cilantro",
    "3 teaspoons chili powder",
    "2 1/2 teaspoons cumin",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons lemon juice",
    "1 teaspoon paprika",
    "1/2 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon sea salt",
    "1 cup raw walnuts (soaked overnight (I use NOW Foods brand)",
    "1 medium sized zucchini",
    "1 yellow pepper",
    "1 red pepper",
    "1 avocado",
    "Chili Taco Crema (if you don’t make or have raw cashew milk, replace it with water in this recipe to keep this full raw)",

They are slippery so if you peel over the trashcan hold tight so it doesn’t fall in (don’t ask me how I know this). Slice the peeled zucchini until you fill a 3/4 cup, and add it to a food processor."
