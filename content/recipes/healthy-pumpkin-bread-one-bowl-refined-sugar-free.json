    "1 (15 oz) can pure pumpkin puree",
    "1/2 cup melted coconut oil, use refined if you don’t want it to taste like coconut",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",
    "1/2 cup coconut sugar",
    "1/2 cup unsweetened almond milk",
    "1/4 cup pure maple syrup",
    "2 cups flour (I like to use one cup whole wheat, one cup all purpose)",
    "2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 teaspoons ground nutmeg",
    "1/2 teaspoons ground cloves",
    "1 teaspoon baking powder",

      "text": "Next, add the remaining dry ingredients and mix again until everything is combined. Pour batter into the loaf pan and bake pumpkin bread until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean, 50-55 mins. Let pumpkin bread cool in the pan for 10 minutes and then transfer to a wire cooling rack to cool the rest of the way. If you cut into it before it’s cooled it may seem a little gooey but it won’t be like that if you let it cool longer."
