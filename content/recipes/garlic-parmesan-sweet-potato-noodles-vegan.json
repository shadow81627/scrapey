  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1/4 cup nutritional yeast",
    "1/4 cup raw cashews",
    "2 medium sweet potatoes, peeled (You want them to be pretty uniform in size throughout the whole sweet potato. That will make it much easier for spiralizing.)",
    "2 teaspoons oil of your choice, I used coconut",
    "1/4 cup water",
    "2 teaspoons butter, I used vegan buttery spread",
    "2 large cloves garlic, minced",
    "Salt",
    "Chopped fresh parsley for garnish, if desired"

      "text": "Next, add the water, cover and let sweet potatoes cook for about 10 minutes, stirring once. I like my sweet potato noodles with a little bit to them, but feel free to cook as long or as little as you like."

      "text": "Move sweet potato noodles to the side of the pan and add the butter and garlic. Cook until garlic is fragrant, about 2 minutes. Add in the vegan parmesan and stir everything together. Add in a handful of chopped fresh parsley, if desired. Sweet potato noodles are best when served soon after they’re cooked."
