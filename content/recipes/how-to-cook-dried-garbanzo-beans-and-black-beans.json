When the water begins to boil, reduce the heat to simmer, or a low boil, and cook for 90 minutes, or until the chickpeas are cooked to your desired texture. For a firm and chewy bean cook uncovered and for a creamier softer bean, cover, leaving a bit of a gap to allow steam to escape. Add more boiling water to the pot as needed. If you want your beans to have a salty flavor, add the salt during the last 15 minutes of cooking. If you add it earlier you could end up with tough beans."
