    "1/4 cup vegan butter",

    "16 ounces mushrooms (sliced (I used cremini but you can use any kind you like!)",
    "5 - 6 tablespoons all-purpose flour (gluten-free if preferred)",

Add the onions and garlic and slowly sauté until the onions turn translucent and begin to brown, 5 – 10 minutes. I like to slowly sauté them in this recipe as it allows the onions to caramelize for a rich flavour, but if you’re in a rush, a quick sauté will suffice."

Sprinkle the flour over the mushrooms, using 5 tablespoons for a thinner gravy, and 6 tablespoons for a thicker gravy. Stir the flour in and cook for 1 minute to heat, then stir in the vegetable broth, thyme, and black pepper."
