    "4 large portobello mushrooms (stems removed, wiped clean)",
    "1/4 cup balsamic vinegar",
    "2 Tbsp avocado or olive oil",
    "1 pinch salt and pepper (or red pepper flake)",
    "1 medium red bell pepper (cut into bite-size pieces)",
    "1 small red onion (thinly sliced wedges or diced)",
    "1 head garlic (cloves separated and peeled)",
    "1 healthy pinch sea salt and black pepper (or red pepper flake)",
    "2 Tbsp fresh herbs (such as rosemary or oregano // optional)",
    "3/4 cup pizza sauce*",
    "1/2 cup sun-dried tomatoes (if large, chop into smaller pieces // we prefer Trader Joeâ€™s brand)",
    "1/3 cup soft vegan cheese",
    "Fresh Basil",

Use a pastry brush to brush on all sides (or shake bag to coat). Marinate on one side for 5 minutes, then the other side for 5 minutes."

Cook on each side for about 4-5 minutes, or until caramelized and softened. If your mushrooms are extra thick, covering with a lid can be helpful to encourage even cooking all the way through. Brush on any remaining marinade while cooking to infuse more flavor."
