Once the skillet and oil are hot, swirl to coat the surface of the skillet in oil, then add the tempeh slices. Fry the slices until golden brown on the bottom, then flip and cook on the second side. Add an additional tablespoon of oil for the second side, if needed (tempeh tends to absorb the oil)."
