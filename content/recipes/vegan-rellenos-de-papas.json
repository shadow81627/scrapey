Working with 1 potato ball at a time, set on a work surface and press into the ball to form a cup shape (you can use the bottom of a 1/4-cup measuring cup to form the indentation). Pick up the ball, spoon in 1/4 cup of the mushroom filling, and press 2 olive halves into the filling if using. Gently reshape the potato mixture to completely cover the filling and form into a neat, firm ball. Place on a plate. (At this point, you can coat and fry them, or refrigerate them and then coat and fry later. The colder and firmer they are — at least 2 hours — the easier they are to fry.)"
