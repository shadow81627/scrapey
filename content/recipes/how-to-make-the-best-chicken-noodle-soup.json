    "text": "Extra-Easy Chicken Noodle Soup: Substitute 3 cups pre-cooked shredded chicken or shredded supermarket rotisserie chicken for the chicken thighs in this recipe. Reduce simmering time to 10 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked to taste.Long and Slow Chicken Noodle Soup: Want to make the real thing? OK! Simmer a whole chicken in water until the meat falls off the bones. Pull off the meat and return the bones to the pot with some vegetables to complete the chicken stock. The build your soup as above, using this fresh chicken stock and the reserved chicken meat.Freezing: Remove the portion of soup to be frozen before adding the pasta. When reheating the soup, cook the pasta separately and add it to the individual bowls.Avoiding mushy noodles: The noodles will continue absorbing liquid from the leftover soup as it cools, gradually becoming softer and mushier. If you don&#x27;t like mushy noodles in your leftover soup, keep the pasta and soup separate and add the pasta to bowls individually."
