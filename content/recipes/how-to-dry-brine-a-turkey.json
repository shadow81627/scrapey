    "text": "You can dry-brine a partially frozen turkey: While I prefer starting with a thawed turkey because you can separate the skin from the meat for more even seasoning, you can dry-brine a frozen turkey. See some tips here.Type of salt: The type of salt here is very important. I used Diamond Crystal kosher salt, which is coarser than regular table salt. If you only have a fine salt, use half the amount called for.Brine proportions for a smaller turkey: Turkey sizes vary, so if you have a larger or smaller bird, go by these proportions instead: For every 5 pounds of turkey, you will need 1 tablespoon of kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon dried herbs, and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.Fresh herbs substitution: Instead of dried herbs, you can substitute 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh herbs (or 1 teaspoon per 5 pounds of turkey).Other flavoring ideas: While we use a traditional mix of Thanksgiving herbs here, you can substitute with your favorite dried herbs or spices instead. You can also add in a little brown sugar to the dry brine for a touch of sweetness."
