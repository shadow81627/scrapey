    "1 tsp finely minced garlic",
    "1/4 cup cashew butter (salted - if unsalted, add a bit more tamari)",
    "1 Tbsp tamari (or soy sauce if not GF)",
    "1 Tbsp maple syrup (plus more to taste)",
    "1 Tbsp lime juice (plus more to taste)",
    "1 pinch red pepper flakes",
    "Hot water (to thin)",
    "2 cups kale (torn into small pieces // I also used some green lettuce, which is optional)",
    "1 tsp sesame oil (or sub avocado or olive oil)",
    "1 tsp tamari",
    "6 ounces extra-firm tofu",
    "4 medium radishes",
    "1 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper",
    "1 cup thinly sliced carrot",
    "1 cup fresh basil (rinsed and dried // large stems removed)",
    "6-8 spring roll rice papers (I like this brand)"

Fold the bottom of the wrapper over the fillings, firmly tucking them into each other, then fold the sides over the center, and continue rolling until the salad roll is seam side down."
