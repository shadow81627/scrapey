With the motor running, slowly add in the coconut oil until it is completely incorporated. The crumbs should stick together when pressed between your fingers. Transfer the crust mixture to your prepared pie pan and evenly spread it across the bottom and up the edges. The crust should be about1/4\" thick. Place it in the oven and bake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and let the crust cool while making your filling."
