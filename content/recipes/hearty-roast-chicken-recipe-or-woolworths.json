      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C (Gas 6). Sit the chicken in a roasting tin, then coat evenly all over with the butter - this ensures crisp, evenly golden skin. Stuff the lemon quarters into the body cavity - to help keep the meat moist - and season the chicken all over with salt and black pepper."

      "text": "Roast in the oven for about 1 1/4 hours until cooked through and golden, basting with the juices at intervals as it cooks (about 3 times in all). To check whether the chicken is cooked, pierce the thickest part of the thigh with a knife. If the juices run clear, it is done; if it is pink or bloody, cook for a little longer. Remove to a large plate, cover with foil, and leave to rest in a warm place for about 15 minutes before carving."

      "text": "To make the gravy, tilt the roasting tin at a slight angle, and skim off any fat. Put the tin on the hob or stovetop, and add the stock or water. Bring to the boil, scraping up any bits from the bottom of the tin with a wooden spoon. Reduce the heat slightly, add more seasoning, if you wish, and simmer for 10 minutes. Pass through a sieve if you wish, or serve as it is with the carved chicken. Serve with roast or sautéed potatoes, and seasonal vegetables."
