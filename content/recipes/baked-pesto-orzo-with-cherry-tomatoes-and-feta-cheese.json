Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and toss together the cherry tomatoes, olive oil, smashed garlic cloves, thyme and salt and pepper (to taste). Roast tomatoes until starting to burst open, 12-15 minutes. Set aside. I like to mince up the roasted garlic and add it back to the tomatoes along with the thyme leaves."
