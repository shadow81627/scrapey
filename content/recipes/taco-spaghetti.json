Add the beans and corn and refrigerate in an airtight container; cube and grate the cheese and refrigerate in separate airtight containers. When ready to finish, boil the spaghetti, assemble, and bake as directed. Alternatively, taco spaghetti can be completely assembled ahead of time, covered, and refrigerated overnight. Remove from the refrigerator while the oven heats and bake as directed, it may need a few more minutes baking time.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days."
