    "text": "Mini scones: After cutting the scones into 8 triangles, cut each in half again before baking to form 16 mini scones, which are perfect for tea parties.Make ahead: The scones can be cut and frozen unbaked. Freeze on the baking sheet until solid, then store in a freezer bag. Bake directly from frozen for about the same amount of time.Storage: Baked scones can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. Rewarm in a 350ºF oven until heated through, about 5 minutes."
