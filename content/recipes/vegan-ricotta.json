You can open the cheesecloth and use the ricotta immediately or you can transfer the ricotta curds to a cheese mold or ricotta basket to get a more traditional ricotta shape. You can also leave it for a few more days in the cheesecloth over the sieve and bowl to become drier and firmer if you want to."

Fold up a few pieces of kitchen paper or a clean cloth and lay it on a plate, then sit the basket of ricotta on top. Cover with an upturned bowl and put in the fridge for a couple of hours (or longer) before carefully turning out of the basket to reveal your perfect little ricotta."
