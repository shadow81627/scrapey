    "9 ounces farro perlato (semi-pearled emmer), about 1 1/3 cups uncooked (see substitutes below)",
    "1 teaspoon chia seed or ground flaxseeds",
    "3 medium zucchini (trimmed and halved lengthwise)",
    "1/2 red bell pepper (seeded)",
    "12-16 ounces cherry tomatoes (halved)",
    "2 green onions (green parts only, thinly sliced)",
    "2 tablespoons white balsamic or white wine vinegar",
    "1 tablespoon lemon juice",
    "2 teaspoons spicy or Dijon mustard (or to taste)",

    "1/4 teaspoon salt (optional)",

Add enough water to cover it by at least an inch and a half, bring to a boil, and cook until it’s tender but still firm, about 20 minutes. Before draining it, remove 1/4 cup of the cooking water and mix it with the chia seed in a small bowl. Drain the farro, rinse it with cold water, and place it in a large serving bowl."

Remove them from the grill to a cutting board and cut into 1/2-inch slices; add them to the farro. Grill the pepper just until grill marks appear. Remove it to the cutting board, chop it, and add it to the farro, along with the tomatoes and green onions."
