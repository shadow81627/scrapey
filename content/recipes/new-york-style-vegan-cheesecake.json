This will allow the cheesecake to bake uniformly. Line a 10\" springform cake pan with parchment paper and spray the bottoms and sides thoroughly. Set aside."

Once the crackers are broken down, slowly add the melted butter and process until well combined. The crust should stick together when pressed between your fingers. Transfer crust onto the prepared cake pan, evenly pressing the crust down around the bottom of the pan with your fingers, and set aside."

The cheesecake will be wobbly, but start pulling away from the sides and cracking a little on the top when it's done. Remove from oven and let cool for 60 minutes before putting in the refrigerator to chill for at least 4 hours."
