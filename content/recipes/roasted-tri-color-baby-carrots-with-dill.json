    "3 to 4 bunches of baby carrots – approximately 15 to 20 carrots",
    "1 teaspoon of olive oil",
    "Ground sea salt and black pepper to taste",
    "2 to 3 tablespoons of chopped dill"

      "text": "Cut off stems—leave a few inches of the stems on the carrots—and wash them really well. Once they’re clean, GENTLY peel off a thin layer of the skin. If the carrots look super clean you can skip this part, but mine needed it."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Put the carrots on a rimmed baking sheet and drizzle a teaspoon of olive oil over the carrots and toss to coat. There were only about six to eight carrots per bunch in mine, if you have more you may want to add another teaspoon of olive oil. If you don’t use oil to cook, that’s fine, just omit it. I like to roast baby carrots with a little oil so they don’t dry up."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Season with sea salt and black pepper and roast in a 375° oven for fifteen to twenty minutes, checking them every ten minutes. If the thinnest carrots are done before the thicker carrots, remove them from the oven so they don’t char."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "When the carrots are done (it should be easy to pierce them with a fork) remove them from the oven and sprinkle with as much or as little chopped dill as you like."
