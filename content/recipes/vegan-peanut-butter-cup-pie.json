    "1 sleeve graham crackers (or sub similar gluten-free cracker/cookie)",
    "4 1/2 Tbsp melted vegan butter or coconut oil",
    "12 ounces firm silken tofu (slightly drained and patted dry)",
    "1/2 cup creamy salted natural peanut butter (I like Trader Joeâ€™s brand)",
    "1/4 cup agave nectar or maple syrup (or sub honey if not vegan)",
    "1 14-ounce can full-fat coconut milk OR coconut cream",
    "1 cup semisweet dairy-free chocolate chips",
    "1/3 cup non-dairy milk (I used full-fat coconut, but almond milk is fine, too)"
