    "1 cup rolled oats (ensure certified gluten-free as needed)",
    "1/2 cup natural peanut butter",
    "1/2 cup canned pumpkin purée",
    "1/4 cup dry roasted peanuts (or sub chopped pecans)",
    "1/4 cup maple syrup",
    "1 tsp pumpkin pie spice",
    "1 tsp cinnamon",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",

      "text": "Use a cookie scooper (like this one) or tablespoon to measure out 1 1/2 Tbsp amounts of dough to gently roll into balls. Arrange on the baking sheet and press down gently with the palm of your hand or a lightly oiled glass to smash slightly. They won’t spread much, so it’s okay if there’s not much space between the cookies."
