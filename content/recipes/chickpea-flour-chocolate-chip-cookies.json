    "description": "CHICKPEA FLOUR CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES ,  VEGAN GLUTEN FREE COOKIES \n\nGet the WRITTEN RECIPE here -  https://www.veganricha.com/chickpea-flour-chocolate-chip-cookies/\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThese huge Chickpea Flour Chocolate Chip Cookies are Chewy just like regular cookies. These cookies need 1 Bowl, are grain-free, gluten-free, vegan and can be made nut-free. Loads of protein\n\nChewy, huge, full of chocolate is what I want in my chocolate chip cookie. And a twist of course, like this one. Cookies made with chickpea flour.  \n\nChickpea flour has a distinct flavor profile and it gets more pronounced during baking. It can taste bitter or raw depending on how it is used. In this cookie, the molasses and maple balance that out into a nuttier profile. Loads of chocolate can only make it better. \n\nI like these Chickpea flour cookies with the added almond flour, which adds more structure and texture to make them more like a regular chocolate chip cookie. You can use more chickpea flour to make these without almonds (nut-free). Add 1 tbsp more chickpea flour and add more later at step 4 before baking if the mixture is too loose. \n\n******MORE COOKIE RECIPES  FROM THE BLOG******\n\nOATMEAL WALNUT CHOCOLATE CHUNK COOKIES: https://www.veganricha.com/oatmeal-walnut-chocolate-chunk-cookies/\n\nPEANUT BUTTER COOKIES WITH PECANS: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-peanut-butter-cookies-with-pecans/\n\nTHE ULTIMATE GIANT VEGAN CHOCOLATE CHIP & CHUNK COOKIES: https://www.veganricha.com/the-ultimate-chocolate-chip-chunk/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#vegancookies #chickpeaflourcookies #veganchocolatecookies #veganricha",
