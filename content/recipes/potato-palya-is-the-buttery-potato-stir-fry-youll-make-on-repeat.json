    "2 tablespoons fresh cilantro",
    "2 tablespoons canola or vegetable oil, plus more as needed",
    "1 tablespoon ghee or unsalted butter",
    "1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds",
    "Pinch asafetida (hing) powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon chana dal (dried split chickpeas)",

Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer until the potatoes are cooked through and tender, about 15 minutes. Meanwhile, peel and grate a 1-inch piece fresh ginger until you have 2 teaspoons. Dice 1 medium yellow onion. Trim and chop 1 Indian green chile or serrano chile (remove the seeds and membranes first if you want it less spicy), or stem and break 1 dried red chile in half. Squeeze 1 tablespoon lemon juice and coarsely chop 2 tablespoons fresh cilantro."

When it sizzles and pops, add 1/2 teaspoon black mustard seeds and a pinch of asafetida powder. Immediately cover the pan when the mustard seeds start popping. When the popping starts to subside, add 1/2 teaspoon chana dal and 1/2 teaspoon urad dal. Stir to coat with the oil and reduce the heat to medium-low. Cook, stirring often so they evenly toast, until they turn a reddish golden-brown color and smell nutty, less than 1 minute."
