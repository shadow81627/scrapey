    "1 small-medium head cauliflower (cut into even, bite-size florets)",
    "1 healthy pinch each sea salt and black pepper",
    "2 large eggs, beaten (organic pasture-raised when possible // see notes for vegan option)",
    "1 1/2 cups raw cashews (or sub other nut, such as almonds or almond flour, though we havenâ€™t tested these ourselves)",
    "1 1/4 tsp sea salt (plus more to season cauliflower before coating)",
    "1/4 tsp cayenne pepper (increase for more spice)",
    "3/4 tsp garlic powder",
    "1 tsp smoked paprika",
    "2 Tbsp arrowroot starch, cornstarch, or potato starch",
    "1 spritz avocado oil (optional // from a spray bottle // otherwise omit)",
    "2 Tbsp honey (if vegan, sub maple syrup)",
    "3 Tbsp hot sauce or buffalo sauce",
    "1 pinch red pepper flake (optional)"

      "text": "Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. If you have a cooling rack that is oven safe, you can place that over the parchment paper; it will help the cauliflower crisp up even more. However, we tested it with and without and both work. The primary difference is when not using a cooling rack, the cauliflower undersides can get a little more brown. But the easy workaround is cooking the cauliflower in the upper third of the oven to prevent the bottoms from burning."
