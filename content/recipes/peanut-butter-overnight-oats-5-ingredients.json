    "1/2 cup unsweetened plain almond milk (or sub other dairy-free milks, such as coconut, soy, or hemp!)",
    "3/4 Tbsp chia seeds",
    "2 Tbsp natural salted peanut butter or almond butter (creamy or crunchy // or sub other nut or seed butter)",
    "1 Tbsp maple syrup (or sub coconut sugar, organic brown sugar, or stevia to taste)",
    "1/2 cup gluten-free rolled oats (rolled oats are best, vs. steel cut or quick cooking)",

See more flavor/topping suggestions in the blog post above!OPTIONAL: You can also heat your oats in the microwave for 45-60 seconds (just ensure there's enough room at the top of your jar to allow for expansion and prevent overflow), or transfer oats to a saucepan and heat over medium heat until warmed through. Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry."
