    "text": "Make ahead: The cookie dough logs can be refrigerated for up to 1 week. They can also be frozen for up to 3 months. Unwrap frozen cookie dough and let it warm on the counter for 10 to 15 minutes. It should still be cold to the touch and firm, but slightly pliable. Slice the cookies into 1/4-inch-thick disks and bake as directed by the recipe, adding on an extra minute or two to the baking time.Storage: Store the baked cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days."
