  "description": "This cake makes a nice change from pumpkin pie for Thanksgiving, and its beautiful colors are perfect for a festive Christmas dessert. &nbsp;I adapted the recipe from Vegan Holiday Kitchen by Nava Atlas, eliminating the small amount of oil in the original. Use her cream cheese frosting, if you like, or simply sprinkle with confectioners sugar for a very low-fat dessert.",
