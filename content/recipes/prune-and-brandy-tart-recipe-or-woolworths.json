  "recipeIngredient": [
    "150g ready-to-eat prunes",
    "3 tbs brandy",
    "250g ready-made shortcrust pastry, preferably all-butter",
    "1 tbs plain flour (to dust)",
    "5 large egg, yolks",
    "50g caster sugar",
    "1.2 cup double cream",
    ".5 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1 pinch grated nutmeg",

      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Soak the prunes in the brandy. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface and use to line the tart tin. Trim off any excess around the edges, then line the pastry case with baking parchment and ceramic baking beans. Bake for 20 minutes, then remove the parchment and beans and return to the oven for 5 minutes to dry the pastry out. Set to one side while you make the filling. Turn the oven down to 150°C."

      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Put the egg yolks and sugar in a mixing bowl and stir together until well combined. Heat the cream, vanilla extract, and nutmeg in a pan until almost boiling, then whisk into the egg yolk mixture. Strain into the pastry case and scatter over the soaked prunes. Bake for 40-45 minutes, or until just set - the tart should wobble slightly in the centre when you shake the tin. Remove from the oven and leave to cool, then chill until ready to serve. Dust with icing sugar before serving."
