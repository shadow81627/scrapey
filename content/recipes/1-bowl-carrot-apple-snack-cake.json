    "1 1/2 Tbsp flaxseed meal (to make flax eggs)",
    "3 3/4 Tbsp water (to make flax eggs)",
    "1/4 cup olive oil (if avoiding oil, try subbing a little nut butter or applesauce)",
    "1/3 cup mashed very ripe banana",
    "1/4 cup maple syrup",
    "1/2 cup brown sugar (or sub coconut sugar, but it’s not as sweet and the texture may be more dense)",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 cup plain unsweetened almond milk (or other dairy-free milk)",
    "1 heaping cup (packed) grated carrot",

    "2/3 cup gluten-free rolled oats",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking soda",
    "1/2 cup almond meal (or flour)",
    "1 heaping cup gluten-free flour blend",
    "1/4 cup raw walnuts (chopped // for topping)",
    "1 1/4 cup raw cashews (soaked in very hot water for 30 minutes)",
    "1 Tbsp coconut oil (melted // optional - helps the frosting firm up when chilled)",
    "1/4 cup full-fat coconut milk (or sub light // if avoiding coconut, sub almond or rice)",
    "2 Tbsp lemon juice",
    "3 Tbsp maple syrup (plus more to taste)",

Bake for 40-45 minutes on a center rack or until deep golden brown and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. When you press on the top, it shouldn’t feel too spongey, so don’t be afraid of over-baking! The GF blend just takes longer to bake than glutenous cakes."

Taste and adjust sweetness or tartness as needed by adding more maple syrup or lemon juice, respectively. Then refrigerate to firm. Wait to frost the cake until frosting has thickened (about 2 hours), and the cake has cooled completely."
