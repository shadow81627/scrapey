    "1 large eggplant (cut into 1/4 inch rounds // skin on)",
    "2 cups onion (diced // any kind – I used yellow)",
    "3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "Olive oil",

      "text": "While eggplant is roasting, heat a large skillet over medium heat and add 2-3 Tbsp olive oil. Add onion and stir often until caramelized – turn heat to low if browning too quickly. Add minced garlic in the last few minutes so it doesn’t burn. Set aside."
