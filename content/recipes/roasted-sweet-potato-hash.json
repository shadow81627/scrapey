      "text": "Pre-heat oven to 425 degrees F. Start by preparing your sweet potato and veggies. I like to peel my sweet potato but that step is optional. Dice sweet potato, bell peppers and onion into bite size pieces and place on a large baking sheet."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Drizzle the veggies with olive oil and add all your seasonings. Use your hands to toss everything together and arrange in a single layer on your sheet pan. Place pan into the oven and roast for about 30-35 minutes, stirring once. I like my veggies to be super caramelized and the sweet potato starting to brown too, but you can take them out a little earlier if you prefer."
