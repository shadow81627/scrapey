      "text": "Add tomatoes, harissa and 1/3 cup water, stirring to combine. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring regularly, to allow flavours to develop and sauce to thicken. Reduce heat to low. Using a spoon, make a hole in the sauce and crack an egg into it. Repeat with remaining eggs. Using a fork, drag egg whites to allow them to mix slightly with the sauce. Simmer for 10-12 minutes or until eggs are cooked to your liking. Scatter over parsley and drizzle with extra oil. Serve with toast."
