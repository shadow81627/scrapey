    "description": "This 1 Bowl Vegan Chocolate Gingerbread Cake has an amazing flavor profile. Ginger, candied ginger, dark chocolate add a pleasing bitter combination with gingerbread spices.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/12/vegan-chocolate-gingerbread-cake.html\n\nGinger and Chocolate in baked goods work very well together in the cold season. This loaf has cocoa, fresh ginger and gingerbread spices in the wet ingredients and candied ginger and chopped up chocolate in the dry. It bakes into a slightly dense pound cake like loaf that is best served warm. If storing for longer, warm before serving so that the chocolate can melt a bit and get gooey and delicious. Its almost like a gingerbread brownie! Serve as a snack or top with whipped coconut cream or a chocolate frosting for dessert. \n\n#chocolategingerbread #veganricha #easyveganrecipes #vegancake #chocolategingerbreadcake\nMusic: Milky Way by Joakim Karud",
