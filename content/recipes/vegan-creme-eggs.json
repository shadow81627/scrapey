    "1 tablespoon + 2 teaspoons melted coconut oil (, divided)",
    "1 1/2 cups (150 grams) powdered sugar",

      "text": "Start by gently melting the chocolate with 2 teaspoons of coconut oil. The easiest way to do this is to simply place them both in a bowl over a pan of gently simmering water. Be sure that the bowl doesn't touch the water. You can also use a microwave but do it very gradually at a really low temperature and stir well every 20 to 30 seconds or so. Don't rush it because chocolate can burn easily in a microwave."

      "text": "Once the chocolate is liquid and glossy, spoon some into each mold with a teaspoon, and spread it around and up the sides. Make sure it's not too thin as the egg 'shells' need to be pretty sturdy. Leave the remaining chocolate in its bowl and set it aside."

      "text": "Meanwhile, in a small bowl combine the powdered sugar, remaining coconut oil and vanilla. Gradually add the milk a drop at a time, stirring really well between each addition to create a smooth, thick, just droppable paste. This is your \"egg white\"."
