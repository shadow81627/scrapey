  "recipeIngredient": [
    "3/4 cup balsamic vinegar",
    "1 lb Brussels sprouts, rinsed and halved (cut extra large sprouts in quarters)",
    "2 tsp avocado oil (see notes for oil-free), divided",
    "1 healthy pinch each sea salt & black pepper",
    "7 cloves garlic, crushed / roughly chopped",
    "1/4 cup dried cherries, roughly chopped (or sub other semi-tart dried fruit of choice)",
    "2 Tbsp dairy-free cheese"

      "text": "Add balsamic vinegar to a small saucepan and bring to a very low boil over medium heat. Then reduce heat slightly (medium low to low) to a steady simmer (bubbles should be consistently forming around the sides and in the center of the pot — but not a full boil). Continue cooking until reduced by half and the vinegar leaves a thin film on the bottom of the pan when tipped to the side, ~15-20 minutes. Watch carefully toward the end to ensure it doesn’t burn."

      "text": "OPTIONAL: For extra crispy sprouts, heat a large (oven-safe) pan (preferably cast iron) over medium-high heat. Once hot, add a drizzle of oil (remaining 1 tsp as original recipe is written) and swirl pan to coat. Add half of the Brussels sprouts (or as many as will comfortably fit in the pan) cut-side down and sear for 3-4 minutes, or until light golden brown on the underside. Then transfer the pan to the prepared baking sheet. Repeat this step (adding more oil to the pan as needed) until all sprouts have been seared and are on the baking sheet."
