If using fresh raspberries, squash them lightly so they release some of their juices, then spoon half over the sponge cake. If using frozen, drain the fruit (reserving the juice), then spoon half over the cake together with 2 tablespoons of juice. Place in the refrigerator for at least 15 minutes while the sponge soaks up the juices."

Break three-quarters of the chocolate up into small pieces and place in a small heatproof bowl. Sit the bowl over a pan of simmering water and stir until the chocolate has melted.
