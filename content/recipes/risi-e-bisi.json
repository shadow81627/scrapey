  "description": "Risi e Bisi (Italian Rice &amp; Peas) is a simple, humble and comforting one-pot recipe which originates from Venice. It&#039;s got a great flavour base from plenty of sweet leeks and green peas and it&#039;s creamy and rich with none of the fussiness of a risotto. In fact it&#039;s really easy to make and very family friendly.",

It will continue to thicken a bit as it cools while you serve it up. (See the progress shots in the post above for how it should look when it's ready)."
