Bake in the centre of the oven for 35-40 minutes, until well risen and golden brown - a wooden toothpick inserted into the centre of the cake should come out clean. Remove the cakes from the oven and leave them to cool in their tins for 5 minutes, before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely."

Use about one-third of the frosting to sandwich the two cake halves together. Cover the top and sides of the cake with the rest of the frosting. Chill in the fridge for 1 hour to help set the frosting."
