  "description": "What happens when two of our favorite desserts combine? This Apple Pie Cheesecake! It’s a fluffy, decadent cheesecake filled with apple pie flavors. We used low-fat cream cheese and yogurt instead of full fat cream cheese and sour cream for a lightened-up dessert with cooked apples folded in rather than just placed on top. A crumb topping finishes it all off with the perfect bite! ",
