Using a sharp knife, score a diamond pattern into the fat, taking care that you don’t cut all the way through to the meat. Place ham on a rack in a roasting dish and pour 2cm of water into the base of the pan."

      "text": "Brush syrup over ham to coat well. Bake ham for 1 hour, re-brushing with rhubarb glaze every 15 minutes, until glossy. Serve ham with rhubarb pulp and any remaining glaze. Serving suggestion: Add the cranberries to the rhubarb glaze in the last 15 minutes of cooking. Remove from the oven and allow to cool slightly. Spoon the cranberries over the top of ham so they sit on top as a lovely decoration."
