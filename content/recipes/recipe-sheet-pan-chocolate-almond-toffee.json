      "text": "Attach a deep-fry or candy thermometer to a medium, heavy-bottomed saucepan. Add the butter and place over medium-high heat until just melted but not bubbling. While whisking, gradually pour in the sugar and salt and cook, whisking the bubbling mixture frequently, until the mixture turns the color of peanut butter and registers about 290°F on a candy thermometer (be careful not to cook it until it smokes), 10 to 15 minutes. If the mixture separates while it is cooking, just keep whisking — it will come together eventually. Working quickly, remove from the heat and carefully whisk in the vanilla, as it will bubble up."

Sprinkle evenly with the chocolate and let sit until mostly melted, about 5 minutes. Spread the chocolate with an offset metal spatula or a silicone spatula into an even layer. Sprinkle with the nuts and gently press them into the chocolate with the palms of your hands."
