    "1/3 cup amaranth",
    "1/3 cup firmly packed light brown sugar",
    "1/2 cup honey",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter",

If it dances across the bottom of the pan and evaporates, you're good to go. Add 1 tablespoon of amaranth to the pan, place the lid over the top, and slide the pan back and forth to pop. The amaranth should pop within 10-12 seconds. Pour the popped amaranth into the large mixing bowl with the oats and nuts then repeat the process with the remaining amaranth one tablespoon at a time."

Reduce heat to low and simmer until the sugar dissolves and a light brown caramel forms, about 5 minutes -- don't let it over-cook! Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla. (Be careful at this point -- the addition of the vanilla extract will cause the mixture to splatter.)"

Pour the cereal mixture into the prepared baking dish and spread it out into an even layer. Cover the pan with a second piece of parchment and use the bottom of a glass or your hands to firmly press down on the granola mixture to compress the bars. When the top of the granola bar mixture is evenly compressed and you cannot press the mixture in any further, let the granola bars sit for 2-4 hours at room temperature until firm and completely set."
