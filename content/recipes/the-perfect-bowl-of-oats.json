      "text": "Add 1 cup oats to a large saucepan and top with 2 cups water (or, if making more or less, just make sure there is double the water as there are oats). Cover and soak for 6 hours or overnight (see notes for shortcuts). This will improve digestibility and also slightly speed cooking time. It also yields fluffier, creamier oats!"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "The following day (or 6 hours later), add a pinch of salt and bring to bubbling boil over high heat. Once bubbling, reduce to a simmer, cover, and cook for 12-15 minutes or until the water is mostly absorbed and the oats are tender. If the oats appear dry, add more water as needed. Then remove from heat."
