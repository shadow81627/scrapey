    "1 Tbsp flaxseed meal (to make a flax egg)",
    "2 1/2 Tbsp water (to make a flax egg)",
    "3/4 cup packed brown sugar",
    "1/2 cup softened vegan butter",
    "2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1 heaping cup Minimalist Baker Gluten-Free Flour Blend* (1 cup + 2 Tbsp as original recipe is written)",

      "text": "Meanwhile, preheat your oven to 350 degrees F (176 C) and line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper. When the dough is done chilling, use a cookie scoop to scoop out ~18 cookies, keeping them in mound shapes and spacing 2 inches apart (adjust amount of cookies if altering the default number of servings). Bake for 10-14 minutes â€” until edges are golden and centers are soft. Option to sprinkle with flaky salt for extra flavor!"
