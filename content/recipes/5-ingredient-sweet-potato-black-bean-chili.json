    "1 15-ounce can black beans (with salt // if unsalted, add more salt // slightly drained)",
    "2 cups vegetable stock",
    "2 cups water",
    "1 Tbsp chili powder",
    "2 tsp ground cumin",
    "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 tsp chipotle powder",

Add black beans, cover and cook for at least 20 minutes more, preferably 30 - or until the sweet potatoes are fork tender and the soup and thickened. This soup is at its best when prepared the night before or allowed to rest for a few hours so the flavor marries with the vegetables and beans."
