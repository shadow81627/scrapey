Trim away the excess, line the pastry shell with greaseproof paper, and fill with ceramic baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15-20 minutes until the edges are golden. Remove the beans and paper, brush the bottom of the shell with the extra egg, and return to the oven for 2-3 minutes to crisp. Remove from the oven, and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C."

Spread the pesto evenly over the bottom of the pastry shell, then carefully pour in the pepper mixture. Bake in the oven for 25-35 minutes until set. Leave to cool for 10 minutes before releasing from the tin. Garnish with extra basil leaves, and serve with a wild rocket and fennel salad."
