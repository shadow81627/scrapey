Pulse the blender (I used the crushed ice setting), multiple times, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender, and push the ice cream cubes towards the blade if needed. This may take a bit of time and effort. If needed you can add a splash of plant-based milk to the blend, but do not add too much or you may make your ice cream too thin. Continue blending until you reach a soft serve consistency."

You can optionally stir in any add-ins you like such as crumbled cookies, chocolate chips, nuts, or you can swirl in peanut butter, almond butter, or strawberry jam."
