Place coconut chips in a larger bowl and toss with maple syrup/soy sauce mixture. Transfer to a single layer on a baking sheet and bake for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally. Keep a close eye on the coconut to prevent burning. Remove from oven and set aside to let cool while making the soup."

Alternatively, you can bake the potatoes by wrapping them in tin foil and baking them at 425F for 60 minutes. Once the potatoes are done, let them cool slightly before removing the skin and cuting them into 1\" cubes."
