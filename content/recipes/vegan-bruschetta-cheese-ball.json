    "1/2 teaspoon sea salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon ground mustard",
    "1/4 cup fresh tomatoes (, chopped)",
    "2 tablespoons fresh basil (, sliced)",

This will help draw out the small amount of moisture that is in the cheese, firming it up a bit. You don’t have to use a strainer but that helps keep its shape."

You can use a drizzle of oil if you prefer to get an even crispier result. You can do this the same day you make the cheese ball, then store in a container until the next day when you coat it."
