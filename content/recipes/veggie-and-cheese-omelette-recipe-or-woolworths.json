When butter is sizzling, pour a quarter of the egg mixture into a pan, gently rolling to coat. As egg begins to cook around the edge of the pan, gently drag towards the centre of the pan with a spatula. When egg is set, sprinkle a quarter of the vegetable mixture and a 1/4 cup of the cheese on the omelette half (furthest away from the pan handle). Fold remaining portion over filling. Turn omelette out onto a serving plate. Repeat with remaining butter, egg mixture, vegetable filling and cheese. Top with tomato and parsley. Serve with rye."
