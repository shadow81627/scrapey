    "1 (10 ounce) bag vegan chocolate chips",

    "1/4 cup vegan powdered sugar",

Once creamer is ready, pour over the chocolate chips and cover for 3-5 minutes. Remove cover and stir together with a spatula until the chocolate and cream come together to create a homogeneous thick sauce. Be careful not to over mix."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "While your chocolate ganache cools, make your caramel sauce. Place the sugar and water in a very clean medium-sized pot set over high heat and bring to a boil. Do not stir. Agitating the sugar will cause crystallization. Continue boiling for about 10 minutes until the sugar has melted and begins to turn a rich golden brown. Immediately remove from heat and slowly add coconut milk while whisking. Whisk until combined. If the sugar starts to clump together, return the caramel sauce to a low heat while continuing to stir."

      "text": "When the ganache and caramel sauce has cooled, make the coconut whipped cream. Skim off the solid top half of chilled coconut milk. Make sure your coconut milk has separated, otherwise you will not get the right consistency. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla extract, and whip together with a handheld mixer."
