    "3/4 tsp toasted sesame oil",

      "text": "While the tofu is marinating, whisk together the arrowroot and a splash of water in a small saucepan, then add the reserved marinade. Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently until thickened to a glossy glaze — about 2-3 minutes. If it thickens too much, add a little water to thin. If it’s too thin, whisk more arrowroot with water, then add to the saucepan and cook to thicken."

Thread cubed tofu and red onion onto skewers, alternating with 1 piece of red onion in between each tofu cube and ending with a piece of red onion. There should be ~8 tofu cubes per skewer."
