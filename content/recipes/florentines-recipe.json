  "description": "Even though the name sounds wholly Italian, these cookies most likely originated in French kitchens, with the name simply a nod to the Tuscan city. As beautiful as they are tasty, don’t be intimidated by the Florentine; they are a snap to make. Be sure to leave extra space in between each cookie, as they spread! Aim for about six per standard-size cookie sheet. Gluten-free, vegan, soy-free, corn-free, bean-free",

      "text": "• In a medium bowl, combine the almonds and the brown rice flour. In a small saucepan, mix together the sugar, margarine, agave, and salt and bring to a boil, stirring often. Remove immediately from heat and stir mixture into the almond mixture. Mix until totally combined and drop by heaping table- spoons onto a parchment-lined cookie sheet, about 3 inches apart. Using a lightly greased fork, press down cookies into a flat circle, so that the almonds are in a single layer."

Let cool completely and then drizzle with melted chocolate and sprinkle with orange peel. Let chocolate firm up before serving. Store in airtight container up to 1 week."
