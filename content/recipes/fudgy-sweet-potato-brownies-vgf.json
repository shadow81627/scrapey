    "1 tsp pure vanilla extract",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp avocado oil (or sub melted vegan butter, melted coconut oil, or olive oil)",
    "1/2 cup cocoa powder or cacao powder",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 tsp baking powder",
    "2/3 cup oat flour",
    "1/2 cup chopped raw pecans (or sub walnuts, but we liked pecans better)",
    "1/4 cup dairy-free chocolate chips (optional)",

Bake at 375 F (190 C) for ~25-30 minutes or until tender to the touch. Move to one side of pan and wrap the parchment paper over top to steam. Let steam for 5 minutes. Then peel away skin and mash in a mixing bowl (or food processor). Set aside."

      "text": "Bake on the center rack (at 350 F / 176 C) for 28-32 minutes. The brownie edges should appear slightly dry and a toothpick inserted into the center should come out mostly clean (a few crumbs are okay, but it shouldn’t be overly gooey). Remove from oven and let cool in the pan for 30 minutes - 1 hour."
