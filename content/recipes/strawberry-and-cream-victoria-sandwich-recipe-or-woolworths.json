      "text": "Preheat the oven to 180°C. Line the bases of the sandwich tins with baking parchment. In a bowl, mix the butter and sugar with an electric hand whisk until light and creamy. Whisk in the eggs a little at a time, adding in a little of the flour if the mixture looks as if it is going to curdle. Sift in the remaining flour and fold in gently with a large metal spoon. Divide the mixture between the tins and bake for 25 minutes, or until risen and firm to the touch. Leave to cool in the tins for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
