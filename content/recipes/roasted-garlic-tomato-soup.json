Place the garlic on a piece of aluminum foil, then drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Wrap it in the foil then bake for about 50 to 55 minutes, until tender and the cloves are golden brown. Remove it from the oven, and once it is cool enough to handle, squeeze the cloves out of the peel, then use a fork to mash them into a paste. Measure out 1 tablespoon of the mashed garlic to use in the soup. Any extra can be stored in an airtight container in the fridge."
