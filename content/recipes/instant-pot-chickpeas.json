    "1/4 white onion (leave whole, don’t dice)",
    "2 cloves garlic, peeled",

    "1 handful fresh herbs (we prefer thyme or rosemary)",

NOTE: If you soaked your chickpeas for longer than 8 hours (for instance, overnight or 10+ hours), you can likely cook your chickpeas even faster (anywhere from 12-14 minutes)."

You can also reserve the cooking liquid as it's quite flavorful and can be added to soups and stews (though we don't believe it would be effective for using as aquafaba)."
