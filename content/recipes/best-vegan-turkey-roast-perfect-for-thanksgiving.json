      "text": "Food processor method: Add the tofu, vital wheat gluten, nutritional yeast, water, miso paste, onion powder, vegetable broth powder, garlic powder, salt, thyme, and sage to your food processor. Using the S-blade, blend the mixture until it is mixed well and forms a ball in the food processor. This should happen pretty quickly, but if it doesn't just ensure the ingredients are mixed well, and then you can form the dough into a ball by hand. *Do not knead the dough, kneading it will just make it tough and rubbery.By hand method: If you do not have a food processor, use a blender or immersion blender to blend together everything but the vital wheat gluten together until smooth. Now in a large bowl, use a strong spatula or wooden spoon to mix in the vital wheat gluten, mixing well, until a ball forms (you may need to use your hands as well). *Do not knead the dough, kneading it will just make it tough and rubbery."

      "text": "Place your ball of seitan on a sheet of aluminum foil. You can pat the ball into the shape you desire. I like a slightly oval shape. It doesn't have to be perfect, it will look great even if it's a messy ball. Wrap the foil around the ball securely but not too tightly. I like to do a double layer of foil to ensure it is wrapped well."

      "text": "Add several inches of water to a large pot with a steamer basket and bring to a boil. Once boiling, add the foil-wrapped seitan to the steamer basket, cover, and steam for 1 hour, or until the internal temperature reaches at least 160°F (71°C). The seitan will puff up in the foil and become tight. Once steamed, remove and allow to cool. For the best texture let the seitan cool overnight in the fridge. The roast will shrink and tighten when cooled. You can store the seitan covered in the fridge for up to 3 days or freeze it for later."
