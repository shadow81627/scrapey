Press the bags with the back of a spoon a few times to squeeze all of that flavour out then let it steep for about 15 mins. Remove the tea bags then measure the tea. You need 1 1/2 cups (360mls) of tea for the 3 layer cake, 1 cup (240ml) of tea for the 2 layer cake and 1/2 cup (120mls) of tea for the 1 layer cake or 6 muffins. You should have almost exactly that once you remove the bags and measure. They tend to absorb all of the extra water but if it's a bit over, discard the extra or if it's a little less, top it up with a drop more water."
