    "1 Tbsp instant coffee",

    "1/3 cup canned full-fat coconut milk*",
    "1/3 cup maple syrup",
    "2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1 Tbsp strong brewed coffee (from step 2)",
    "1 pinch sea salt",

Blend until creamy and smooth. If needed, add more coconut milk 1 Tbsp (15 ml) at a time to encourage blending (we didn’t need any), but avoid adding too much — you want the pudding to be thick."

To a separate glass mixing bowl, add coconut milk and microwave until hot but not boiling (alternatively, heat in a saucepan on the stovetop until very hot). Pour the coconut milk directly over the chopped chocolate. Do not stir. Cover with a lid or a piece of aluminum foil to encourage it to melt. Let the chocolate sit, covered, for ~5 minutes to melt."

To chill faster, you can set in the freezer for ~20-25 minutes. Optionally, make it even prettier by adding cocoa powder to a fine mesh strainer and shaking gently over the dishes to add a light dusting."
