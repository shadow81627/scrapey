  "description": "Nothing says the party’s here like a big dish of warm Spinach Artichoke Dip! It’s the perfect crave-worthy appetizer. It’s soft and creamy with loads of flavor and is great eaten warm or at room temperature. Serve it with chips, crackers, baguette slices, vegetable sticks, raw radishes, toast or even garlic bread. I recommend using canned artichokes in brine over the ones you can buy in oil, for the tang they give. It helps cut through the creaminess and adds more depth to the flavor.",

If you use water you will need to add a little more gradually throughout, to prevent the onion sticking. Add the chopped garlic in the last 2 minutes of cooking; then remove the pan from the heat and set aside. Preheat the oven to 400 ° F (200 °C)."
