Once hot, add coconut or avocado oil (or coconut milk if oil-free), press “CANCEL”, and then add cumin seeds and mustard seeds and stir until toasted and fragrant (the residual heat after pressing “CANCEL” will toast them without burning)."

Once the timer goes off, let the steam release naturally for 10 minutes, then manually release any remaining pressure. If in a hurry, you can carefully quick release."
