    "2 Tbsp organic cane sugar",

Then, continue adding flour 1/4 cup at a time until you achieve a soft dough (we added the remaining 1 cup, but you can add more if it's too sticky to handle).

Alternatively, store them loosely covered with a kitchen towel for up to 3 days on the counter. For freezing, we recommend freezing pre-baked, then when ready to prepare, let them thaw, rise, and bake."
