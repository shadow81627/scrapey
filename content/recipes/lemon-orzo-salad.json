    "1/4 cup (60 ml) extra virgin olive oil",
    "1 medium lemon (, the juice and finely grated zest)",
    "1 tablespoon Dijon mustard",
    "1 tablespoon maple syrup (, (or 1 heaping teaspoon sugar)",
    "1 small clove garlic (, grated or very finely minced)",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt (, (plus more to salt the orzo cooking water)",
    "OPTIONAL 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes",
    "2 cups (13 oz / 360 grams) orzo (, uncooked (gluten-free if necessary)",
    "5 to 6 cups (about 4oz/120 grams) arugula (rocket in the UK) (, (1 clamshell type container usually contains about the right amount)",
    "vegan feta (, for crumbling when serving )"

      "text": "Once the water is at a rolling boil add the orzo. Immediately give it a stir, then cook, stirring briefly every couple of minutes until al dente. It usually takes about 1 to 2 minutes less than the package instructions say to cook it for. Keep testing a bit and as soon as it's barely done (softish when you bite but still firm in the centre) that's it. It will continue to soften once mixed with the dressing so it's important not to overcook it."
