  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 Tbsp avocado or olive oil (or sub 1/4 cup water)",
    "1 cup chopped white or yellow onion (1 small onion yields ~1 cup)",
    "2 medium cloves garlic, minced (2 cloves yield ~2 tsp minced)",
    "1 1/2 tsp finely minced fresh ginger",
    "1 cup yellow split peas",
    "1 cup water",
    "2 1/2 cups vegetable broth",
    "3/4 tsp ground turmeric",
    "1 healthy pinch ground black pepper",
    "1/3 cup full-fat coconut milk (canned)",
    "Sea salt, to taste (optional // only if needed)",
    "Coconut milk",
    "Freshly chopped cilantro",
    "Naan",

      "text": "Turn on the sauté function on your Instant Pot (to the default “Normal” — not high or low). Once hot, add oil (or water) and onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently, or until onion is translucent and fragrant. Add ginger and garlic and sauté until fragrant, being careful not to let the garlic burn. Add a little bit more water as needed to prevent sticking."

      "text": "Put on the Instant Pot lid and turn to seal. Pressure cook on HIGH for 15 minutes (it will take about 5-10 minutes for the Instant Pot to pressurize before cooking begins). Once the timer goes off, let the steam release naturally (~15 minutes), or carefully press the quick release if in a hurry. Turn off the Instant Pot by pressing “Cancel.”"

      "text": "Add coconut milk and stir to combine. Optionally, to purée soup, let it cool slightly, then carefully remove the inner pot from the Instant Pot base and tilt the pot to one side while using an immersion blender to purée. This will help prevent splatter. Taste and adjust seasonings as needed, adding salt to taste or coconut milk for creaminess."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Best when fresh. Optionally, garnish with a swirl of coconut milk and freshly chopped cilantro. This soup pairs well with naan or cubed roasted sweet potatoes. Store cooled leftovers in the refrigerator up to 3-4 days or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat in a saucepan on the stovetop, adding a little water as needed to prevent sticking."
