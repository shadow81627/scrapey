    "2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced",
    "4 tablespoons butter, divided",
    "2-3 cloves garlic, minced",
    "1-2 teaspoons fresh thyme leaves, optional",
    "6-8 cups peeled diced potatoes, I like russet but Yukon gold would work well too",

      "text": "Start by caramelizing the onions. Heat a large pan over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons butter and the sliced onions. Stir and let cook for a few minutes and then add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Stir onions every few minutes so that they are able to brown while they cook but not burn. If they seem like they’re getting dry and sticking to the bottom of the pan more than they should, you can add a splash of water or white wine. I usually have to do that a few times during the cooking process. Onions are done when they turn a deep, dark brown color but not a black, burnt color."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once onions are nice and caramelized, add in a few cloves of garlic and the thyme, if using, and let cook for just a minute or two so it isn’t raw. You can caramelize the onions up to 3 days in advance if you like. Just refrigerate until ready to make the mashed potatoes."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add your softened goat cheese to a food processor along with the the caramelized onions. Turn food processor on and slowly drizzle in the milk until you get a nice paste. You can also do this step ahead of time if you like."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Wash, peel and dice your potatoes. You want them to all be similar sized so they take the same amount of time to cook. Place diced potatoes into a large pot and cover with cold water. I also like to add in a few teaspoons of salt, but that is optional. Bring potatoes to a boil and then let simmer until fork tender, 20-25 minutes. Drain potatoes and then add back into the pot."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Use a potato masher to lightly mash potatoes and then add your butter and caramelized onion and goat cheese mixture. Mix everything together and mash until desired consistency is reached. I like to use an electric mixer to ensure the potatoes are as smooth as possible. You can add in extra milk if they’re too thick."
