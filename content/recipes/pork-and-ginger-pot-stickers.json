    "1/2 lb ground pork ($2.75)",
    "1 small head green cabbage ($0.96)",
    "1/2 tsp salt ($0.05)",
    "2 Tbsp vegetable oil ($0.07)",
    "1 inch fresh ginger ($0.11)",
    "1 clove garlic ($0.06)",
    "1 tsp soy sauce ($0.02)",
    "1/4 tsp sesame oil ($0.04)",
    "1 sliced green onion ($0.05)",
    "1/4 large carrot, shredded (optional) ($0.05)",
    "1 package 52 wonton wrappers ($2.39)",
    "3 cubes bouillon ($0.36)",

      "text": "In a large skillet, heat 2 Tbsp of oil over medium/high heat. When it’s hot, add the cabbage and 1/2 tsp of salt. Saute the cabbage until it is translucent and soft (about 15 minutes). Remove from the heat and let cool slightly."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "While the cabbage is sauteing (stir every minute or so), combine the raw ground pork, peeled and grated ginger (use a small cheese grater), minced garlic, soy sauce, sesame oil, sliced green onion an shredded carrot. Mix them all together well with your hands. Add the shredded and cooked cabbage and mix again until it is evenly incorporated (you almost have to use your hands here). Refrigerate the mixture for at least one hour to let the flavors blend. (The cabbage will release gasses as it refrigerates and smell pretty stinky when you come back to it but don’t be afraid. It’s still good and the smell will go away when you cook the pot stickers.)"
