Place it on the stove over medium-high heat and stir well. Once it starts to boil, reduce the heat to medium-low and continue cooking, stirring constantly, until the water evaporates and the sugar starts to thicken and caramelize (keep an eye so they don't burn). Carefully transfer the hazelnuts to the lined baking sheet and let them cool completely (do not touch them with your fingers!). Arrange them on top of the tart before serving"
