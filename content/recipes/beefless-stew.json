  "description": "When I first became a vegetarian many years ago, one of the first recipes I adapted was my mother’s beef stew. Back then I used tempeh and browned it in oil. But once I discovered seitan and TVP chunks, I liked them even better. This stew is super low in fat and a complete meal in itself!",
