  "description": "You won&#039;t believe this vegan tuna recipe! Just 7 ingredients and 1 hour of hands-off baking is all it takes to transform regular watermelon into a tuna steak- no fishies harmed! Nori, soy sauce, miso paste, and a few other ingredients are used to season the watermelon, then the key is to bake the watermelon, which completely changes the watermelon to a tender raw fish texture. This recipe is a must-try!",

      "text": "To serve: You can enjoy the watermelon tuna warm or cold. My favorite way to serve it is to let the watermelon tuna cool completely, then store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 4 days. The longer you store it in the fridge, the more tuna-y it will become! When ready to enjoy, I brush the nori off of the watermelon (which is optional), slice it, and enjoy it like sashimi or make a sushi roll. You can also enjoy it with rice, on noodles, in a poke bowl, or with a side salad and roast potatoes."
