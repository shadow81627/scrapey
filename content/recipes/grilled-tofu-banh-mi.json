    "1 block (350g) extra-firm tofu, (drained, pressed, and sliced into 8 pieces)",
    "3 tablespoons lime juice",
    "2 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "2 tablespoons agave or maple syrup",
    "1 clove garlic, (minced)",
    "1/4 cup vegan mayonnaise",
    "2 teaspoons Sriracha (or to taste)",
    "1 soft baguette cut into 4, or 4 bread rolls",

      "text": "Drain and press the tofu for at least 15 minutes. You can follow the ultimate guide for pressing tofu here. Cut the tofu into 8 slices, then toss the tofu in a bag or a covered dish with the all marinade ingredients, the lime juice, soy sauce, agave, and garlic. You can let this marinate for 15 mintues, or toss it in the fridge to marinate for up to 3 days. I love this because if I don’t use all the tofu in one go, I have tofu in the fridge at the ready!"

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once marinated, grill the tofu a couple minutes per side until it’s browned and even lightly charred on some bits. For added flavour, as it’s cooking brush on a leftover marinade. I used a grill pan for my tofu, but you could also use a BBQ. If you don’t have either you can fry the tofu in a skillet with a bit of oil. I also like to toast my bread a bit by throwing it on the grill for a few minutes."
