    "3 cloves garlic, minced",
    "1 cup chicken or vegetable broth",
    "1/2 cup white wine, amber beer, cider, or more broth",

If the shell is open, tap the mussel lightly against the counter; if the shell doesn't close in a few minutes, discard the mussel."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Debeard the mussels: Many commercial mussels will already be debearded, but it's good to check them anyway. Look for a group of short brown strings coming out the mussel on one side where the two halves of the shell close — this is the \"beard.\" Grip these strings with your fingers or a pair of tweezers and tug gently from side to side. As you tug, the strings will pull out and detach from the shell. It's ok if you don't remove all of the beard or if you miss the beard on a few mussels; it's not harmful to eat, just tough and not very pleasant. (For more instructions, see How To Clean and Debeard Mussels.)"
