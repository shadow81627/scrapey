      "text": "Start assembling the salad by thoroughly washing your lettuce and kale and ripping it or chopping it up into bite size pieces. Traditionally Caesar salad uses whole leaves of lettuce but you could also do a chopped version if you like. I like to cut the kale pretty thinly since it is a little tougher than the romaine lettuce."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add your lettuce and kale to a large bowl. Pour your dressing over and then use a wooden spoon, or your hands, to mix well. You want to make sure that all the lettuce and kale is equally coated with the dressing. Some salads I just pour the dressing right on top at the end but with a Caesar salad it’s important to make sure the dressing is completely incorporated into the salad."
