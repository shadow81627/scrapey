  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Substitutions: Substitute 1 cup panko breadcrumbs for the cornflake cereal (no need to crush). Melt the butter in a medium skillet, add the breadcrumbs, and cook, stirring occasionally, until golden-brown, about 3 minutes. Chicken options: Chicken breast is traditionally used for chicken cordon bleu, but feel free to use dark meat chicken, too. A shredded rotisserie chicken would make for a good mix of white and dark meat.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. "
