I like to heat my tortillas in a pan for a few seconds before adding the fillings so they don’t break when I fold them over. Spread one half of each tortilla with a couple tablespoons of refried beans, top with a spoonful of the veggie mixture and sprinkle some cheese on top. Fold the other side of the tortilla over and place on the baking sheet. Spray the tops with some cooking spray and place in the oven."
