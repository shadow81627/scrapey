    "3-4 cloves garlic",
    "1/2 - 1 tsp red pepper flake (adjust to preferred heat level)",
    "5 Tbsp coconut aminos (or tamari, but start with lesser amount as its saltier)",
    "2 tsp sesame oil (optional)",
    "1 Tbsp maple syrup or raw honey, plus more to taste",
    "2 medium carrots, ribboned with a vegetable peeler",
    "1 medium cucumber,",

Add nut butter of choice to a small blender along with lime juice, garlic, red pepper flake, coconut aminos (or tamari, reduced amount), sesame oil, and maple syrup. Blend until creamy and smooth. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more red pepper flake for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, lime juice for acidity, coconut aminos for saltiness / depth of flavor, garlic for zing, or nut butter for nuttiness / creamy texture. Set aside."

      "text": "Next, prepare veggies. We prefer a vegetable peeler to make “carrot noodles,” a mandolin with a very fine-tooth blade to make angel hair-width cucumber noodles, a mandolin for the cabbage and red bell pepper, and a knife to slice the kale. Also cube mango (see instructions here!). Add all veggie noodles and cubed mango to a large serving dish."
