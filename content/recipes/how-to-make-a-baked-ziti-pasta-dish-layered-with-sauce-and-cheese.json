    "text": "Variations: Feel free to add 2 cups of cooked vegetables or a pound of cooked ground meat or sausage to the sauce. This Italian sausage and peppers baked ziti version is also delicious.Make ahead: This dish can be assembled and refrigerated, covered in foil, up to 2 days in advance. Bake covered for 15 minutes, then uncover and bake for 30 minutes more.Two smaller casseroles: This can be prepared in 2 (8x8-inch) baking dishes instead, which is great if you want to freeze half for a future meal.Freezing: Baked ziti can be frozen right in the baking dish for up to 2 months, just let it cool completely and wrap it tightly in aluminum foil first. Bake straight from the freezer covered with foil for 1 hour, then uncover and bake for 15 minutes more.Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days."
