Drop a floret into the flour mixture and roll to *lightly* coat it with batter (it need not be completely covered). If you end up with too much batter on it, shake it a bit to remove the excess. Transfer the cauliflower to the panko and roll to coat. Place the cauliflower into the prepared baking sheet or skillet. Repeat until all of the cauliflower is used, leaving some space between the florets when you place them in the dish or skillet. Lightly spritz the cauliflower with oil."
