Return the pan to the heat and cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce has thickened. Reduce the heat to low and continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 minutes. Add two-thirds of the grated cheese, season well, and cook for a further 2-3 minutes until thick and creamy."

Cover with half the vegetables, then a layer of lasagne. Repeat the process, finishing with a layer of sauce on top. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top and bake in the oven for 45 minutes - 1 hour, until it is well browned on top and soft when pierced with a knife. Remove from the oven and allow it to rest for 5 minutes before serving."
