  "description": "This decadent spread for crackers and bread is much lighter in fat and calories than the traditional version. I used artichoke bottoms because I like their denser texture for this, but artichoke hearts will also work.",

Taste and add lemon or lime juice, if needed. Refrigerate and allow flavors to blend for at least an hour before serving. (Itâ€™s even better if you let it rest overnight and bring to room temperature before eating.) Spread on good bread or crackers."
