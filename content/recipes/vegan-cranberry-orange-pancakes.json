If you’re cooking with a non-stick pan you may not need to add the oil. When the griddle is hot use a ladle or a measuring cup (the size depends on how large you want your pancakes) and pour onto the griddle. Cook until the center begins to bubble and the edges are firm then flip them over. Cook until the pancake is golden brown and firm to the touch. Cook approximately two minutes per side."
