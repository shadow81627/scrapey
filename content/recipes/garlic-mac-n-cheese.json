    "1 head roasted garlic (see instructions for method)",
    "10 ounces macaroni noodles* (use gluten-free pasta for GF // 10 ounces equals ~2 1/4 cups dry)",
    "4 Tbsp olive or avocado oil",
    "5 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "4-5 Tbsp unbleached all-purpose flour (or sub arrowroot powder for GF)",
    "2 - 2 1/4 cups Blue Diamond Almondmilk Original Unsweetened",
    "~1/2 tsp each salt and pepper (to taste)",
    "1/2 cup vegan parmesan cheese",
    "4-6 Tbsp nutritional yeast (plus more for topping)",
    "1/4 cup panko bread crumbs (optional // gluten-free for GF)"
