    "text": "Roasting mixed vegetables together: You can roast different vegetables on separate trays and combine them after roasting, or you can cook them all on one baking sheet. If cooking on one baking sheet, start cooking the toughest, longest-cooking vegetables first and add the other vegetables later according to their estimated cooking time. For instance, start roasting potatoes for 30 minutes, and then add green beans for the last 15 to 20 minutes of roasting. Be careful not to crowd the pan, or the vegetables will steam instead of roast.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days."

Not only can virtually every vegetable be cooked in this way — no recipe required — but roasted vegetables are also universally pleasurable to eat. Have a picky eater in the house?
