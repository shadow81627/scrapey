      "text": "Add the maple syrup and pumpkin purée to a small saucepan. Heat the mixture over medium heat until it comes to a light boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium-low and bring it to a simmer. Continue cooking until the mixture has reduced by about half (~5-8 minutes). It should coat the back of a spoon without running down the sides — the texture should look like thick caramel sauce."

Then add in the maple/pumpkin sauce and beat again until very light and fluffy. Spoon the maple pumpkin butter into an airtight container and store in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks or in the freezer for up to 1 month."
