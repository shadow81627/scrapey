    "text": "The cookies continue to firm up as they cool, so if they appear a bit soft to the touch right when you pull them from the oven, chances are they&#x27;ll be perfect.Coarse sanding sugar is even better than turbinado sugar for rolling the cookie dough balls because it won&#x27;t melt in the oven and the cookies will look almost sparkly. I didn&#x27;t happen to have any so I used a coarse turbinado, which was an ok stand-in."

    "4 ounces bittersweet chocolate (at least 60% cocoa), chopped",
    "2 ounces semisweet chocolate chips",
    "1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature",

Scoop up roughly 2 tablespoons of the chilled dough and form into balls. Roll in the coarse sugar and transfer to the baking sheets. Using your thumb or index finger, press down firmly into the center of each cookie to form an indentation. Bake the cookies for 12 to 14 minutes, or until dry on top and slightly firm. Once out of the oven, press down gently on the indentations again to reinforce them, and transfer the cookie sheets to racks to cool completely."

Set aside until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes. Using a teaspoon and working neatly, spoon the chocolate filling into the indents in the cookie. Gently sprinkle crushed candy cane bits onto the center of the cookie if you like – or leave as is. Allow the filling to set at room temperature before serving, about 20 to 30 minutes. Cover leftover cookies in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days."
