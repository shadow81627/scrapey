    "1/2 cup fresh squeezed orange juice",
    "2 tablespoons low sodium soy sauce or gluten-free tamari",
    "2 teaspoons agave nectar (or natural sweetener to taste)",
    "1 tablespoon rice vinegar",
    "1/4 teaspoon dark sesame oil (optional but recommended for flavor)",

    "1 large carrot (cut into matchsticks)",
    "1 tablespoon minced ginger root",

Add water chestnuts, garlic, and mushrooms and continue to cook until mushrooms begin to soften, about 2 more minutes. Stir in the bok choy greens, place the tofu on top, and cover tightly. Steam briefly until greens are wilted and bright green, about 1-2 minutes. Stir the orange juice mixture, add it to the skillet, and bring to a boil. Simmer until slightly thickened, about 30 seconds. Serve with rice or other grain."
