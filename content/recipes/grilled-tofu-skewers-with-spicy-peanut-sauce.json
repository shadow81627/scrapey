Heat your BBQ or grill pan over medium-high heat. When hot, grill the skewers for 10 - 15 minutes, turning as needed until grill marks form on each side, brushing with the leftover marinade as they cook. Remove from the heat and serve hot with the spicy peanut sauce on the side for dipping. Decorate with any garnishes you like."
