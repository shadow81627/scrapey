  "description": "Choy sum, also known as choi sum / cai xin / Chinese flowering cabbage / gunsho, is a leafy green stir-fry vegetable that's kind of like a cross between bok choy and rapini. In this simple stir-fry dish, the choy sum is briefly blanched before hitting the pan at high heat with an easy garlic sauce. The resulting dish is delicious and nutritious and would be at home as a side to any Asian-inspired meal.",
