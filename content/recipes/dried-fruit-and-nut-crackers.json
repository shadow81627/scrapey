Slice each half about 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick (see note) (we found that flipping it over and start slicing for the bottom makes it easier). Arrange the slices over the lined baking sheet (you might need to do it in more than one batch) and bake again for about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, flip them over and continue baking for another 15-20 minutes (time may vary depending on the thickness). The crackers might feel slightly soft straight out of the oven, but they will crisp up as they cool"
