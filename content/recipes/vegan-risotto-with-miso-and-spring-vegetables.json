    "5 cups water, divided",
    "4 Tbsp chickpea miso paste (regular soy miso works as well, yellow or white is best here)",
    "2 Tbsp olive oil, divided",
    "1/2 bunch asparagus, cut into 1/2-inch segments on a bias/diagonal",
    "1 cup shiitake mushrooms, sliced",
    "1 pinch each sea salt and black pepper",
    "6 cloves garlic, minced",
    "1 cup arborio rice",
    "1/2 cup dry white wine (optional // or sub vegetable broth)",
    "1/2 cup frozen peas",
    "1/4 cup vegan parmesan cheese"

      "text": "While waiting for the water to simmer, add miso to a small mixing bowl and scoop out ~1 cup (240 ml) of water from the saucepan. Add to the miso and whisk/stir until mostly dissolved (this allows the miso to fully blend with the water and not clump). Add the miso mixture to the pot of simmering water and stir to dissolve the miso fully. This creates your miso broth."

      "text": "RISOTTO: Heat a large rimmed skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 Tbsp (15 ml) olive oil (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Add the asparagus and cook for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, or until somewhat browned and caramelized. Add the mushrooms and sauté for ~2 minutes, or until tender. Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper and transfer to a bowl. Set aside for later."

The heat should be medium, and there should always be a slight simmer. You want the mixture to be cooking but not boiling, or it will get gummy and cook too fast."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once the rice is al dente, turn heat as low as possible and add in peas, along with the cooked asparagus and mushrooms from earlier (option to reserve a few for serving). Stir until well combined, testing a bite to ensure peas are warmed through."
