      "text": "Starting at the bottom about 1/4 of the way up (see photos) smear on peanut butter, add flaxseed, banana and basil and roll the whole thing up like a regular wrap, tucking the sides in as you near the top. If your banana isn’t ripe/sweet enough, add a drizzle of honey or agave to sweeten."
