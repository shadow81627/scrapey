  "description": "This salad takes a little more time to make than the usual shaved sprouts salad, but the extra work is worth the flavor and texture combination of brown butter vinaigrette, Brussels sprouts, apple, and hazelnuts. ",

  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: The salad can be assembled ahead of time and refrigerated for several hours or up to overnight. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before serving. If making more than 2 hours ahead, add the nuts just before serving for best texture.Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 days."

Toast until lightly golden-brown and the skins are peeling away, 10 to 15 minutes. Transfer the nuts to a clean dish towel, wrap up the nuts, and let steam for a minute. Rub the nuts with the towel to remove as many skins as possible. (Not all of the skins will be removed, which is fine.) Coarsely chop the nuts and set aside."
