Stir frequently. Turn the heat down to low and cook for another 15 minutes, or until nicely caramelized. Increase the heat medium ad add the wine, sugar, and salt. Stir well. Cook for approximately 20 to 30 minutes, or until the wine has dissolved and the onions are a deep purple. For the best flavor, allow the onion confit to set overnight in the fridge."
