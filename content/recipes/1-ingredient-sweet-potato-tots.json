Boil sweet potatoes until the outer part is fork tender, but there is still some give in the middle, about 20 minutes. It’s ok if the ends are a little mushy, but you want to be able to actually grate the sweet potato. Remove from water and let cool until you feel comfortable handling them."

You may have to be careful when flipping them because they tend to stick a little at first but if carefully flipped they should stick together just fine! You may want to turn the oven up to 400 for the last 10-15 minutes for a crispier tot."
