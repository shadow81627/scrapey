NOTE: The amount of salt you add will depend on preference. If you typically add more salt to dishes, hold back a bit. If you want this to be a stand-alone spice blend that seasons a salad or hummus, etc, a greater amount of salt is nice for balance and flavor."

Perfect for marinating, garnishing, or adding flavor to just about any dish.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/zaatar/\n\nZa’atar is common in several countries in the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. And it’s especially popular in Lebanon, Israel, Palestine, and Syria. The exact herbs and spices used vary, but typically include a mix of sesame seeds, salt, and dried herbs. Our inspired version most closely resembles the Lebanese version because of the addition of sumac.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
