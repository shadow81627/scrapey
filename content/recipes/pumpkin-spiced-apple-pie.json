    "1/4 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice",
    "3/4 cup cold vegan butter (divided)",
    "2-6 Tbsp ice water",
    "4 1/2 - 5 cups sliced, peeled apples (I like a mix of tart and sweet)",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "1/3 cup sugar (I used part brown sugar, part cane sugar)",
    "2 Tbsp pumpkin butter* (or sub pumpkin puree and add a bit more sugar + cinnamon)",
