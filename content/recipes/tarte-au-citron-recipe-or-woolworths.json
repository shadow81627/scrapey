    "190g plain flour (save 15g for dusting)",
    "85g butter, chilled",
    "45g caster sugar",
    "1 egg, lightly beaten",
    "5 eggs",

      "text": "To make the pastry, rub together the flour and butter with your fingertips, or blitz them in a food processor, until the mixture looks like fine crumbs. Stir in the sugar until well combined. Add the egg and draw the mixture together, first with a fork and then with your hands, to form a ball of dough. If it is too dry and crumbly to come together, carefully add water, 1 tbsp at a time, until it does."

With the tart tin still on the baking tray, pull out the oven shelf, pour in the lemon filling, being careful not to allow it to spill over the edges, and slide the shelf back in. Bake for 30 minutes, or until the filling has just set but retains a slight wobble."
