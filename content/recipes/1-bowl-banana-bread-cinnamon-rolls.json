  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 cup unsweetened plain almond milk",
    "3 Tbsp vegan butter (such as Earth Balance)",
    "1 packet instant/fast-acting yeast (1 packet yields ~2 1/4 tsp) )",
    "1 Tbsp cane sugar",
    "1/4 tsp salt",
    "1/2 cup mashed ripe banana",
    "2 3/4 - 3 1/4 cups all-purpose flour (I used a ratio of 2/3 unbleached all-purpose, 1/3 whole-wheat pastry)",
    "1/4 cup vegan butter",
    "1/3 cup cane sugar",
    "1/2 - 1 Tbsp ground cinnamon",
    "~20 very thin banana slices (1/2 cup yields ~20 slices)",
    "1/3 cup raw walnuts or pecans (optional // crushed // plus more for topping)",
    "1 Tbsp vegan butter",
    "1 Tbsp sugar (cane or brown)",
    "Dairy-free cream cheese frosting",
    "Powdered sugar glaze (see notes)"

      "text": "DOUGH: In a large mixing bowl, heat the almond milk and vegan butter in the microwave in 30 sec increments (or heat over medium heat in a large sauce pan), until warm and melted (never reaching boiling). Let cool to 110 degrees (43 C) - the temperature of bath water. It should be warm but not too hot or it will kill the yeast. (If you used a saucepan to heat the milk, transfer to a large mixing bowl now.)"

The dough will be sticky. When it is too thick to stir, transfer to a lightly floured surface and knead for a minute or so, adding flour as needed, until it forms a loose but still springy ball. Only use as much flour as it will take."

Brush with melted vegan butter and top with cane sugar (I used a little brown sugar mixed in with the cane sugar) and 1/2 - 1 Tbsp cinnamon (up to preference // amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size). Then add banana slices so it's easy to roll, and walnuts."

You can freeze at the stage where the dough is cut into cinnamon rolls and placed in a pan. Cover well and freeze in a pan, then let thaw for at least 6 hours before baking. Cover and set on top of the oven while preheating to help rise. Bake as instructed."
