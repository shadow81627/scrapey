    "description": "The key to a really good pizza is, of course, the crust. I make pizza at home at least once a week, so you can be sure this recipe comes to you after years of very meticulous kitchen testing! Also, the fact that this dough comes together in just a few minutes and doesn't need time to rise means that you can have pizza for dinner any night of the week. It really is that fast and easy, which is why we believe this is the very best thin-crust pizza dough for a home cook on a weeknight.",
