    "1 package coin-shaped refrigerated Korean rice cakes (about 1 pound, 4 cups)",
    "4 tablespoons canola oil, plus more as needed",
    "1 pound fresh Mexican chorizo, casings removed",
    "1 cup fermented Chinese mustard greens, finely chopped",
    "1 cup water",
    "4 medium scallions (green parts only), thinly sliced",
    "1/2 cup Korean chile paste, also known as gochujang",
    "1/2 cup mirin",
    "1/2 cup sake",
    "3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce",
    "1 teaspoon finely grated peeled fresh ginger",
    "1 teaspoon finely grated garlic"

      "text": "For cooking in one pan in batches: Heat a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the oil, then add 1/2 of the chorizo on one side of the pan and press into a 3/4-inch-thick patty. Add 1/2 the rice cakes to the rest of the pan, breaking up the rice cakes with your hands as you drop them in. (Depending on the size of your pan, you may need to add a bit more oil. There should be enough oil that you see it bubbling around the edges of the ingredients in the pan.) Cook undisturbed until the chorizo is cooked on the bottom side and the rice cakes have begun to brown lightly, about 3 minutes. Toss all the ingredients, breaking up the rice cakes and chorizo a little with a wooden spoon and adding more oil, if necessary, to keep a thin layer across the bottom of the pan. Cook 3 minutes more."

Divide between two Asian-style noodle bowls and serve immediately, garnished with half of the green onions. Repeat with the remaining ingredients."
