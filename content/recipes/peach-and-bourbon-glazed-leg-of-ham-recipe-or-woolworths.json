      "text": "Remove skin from ham and using a small, sharp knife cut a diamond pattern over ham fat, taking care not to cut too deeply. Press a clove into the centre of each diamond. Wrap foil around hock to prevent burning. Place ham into prepared pan and brush liberally with peach glaze. Bake for 1 hour, brushing with glaze every 20 minute (if ham should begin to burn or colour too much, cover loosely with foil). Transfer ham to a serving platter and serve with chargrilled peaches, if using."
