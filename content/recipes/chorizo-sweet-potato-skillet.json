    "1 Tbsp olive oil ($0.13)",

    "1/2 lb. Mexican chorizo ($2.75)",
    "1 15oz. can black beans ($0.59)",
    "1 cup uncooked long grain white rice ($0.33)",
    "1 cup salsa (red or green) ($0.46)",
    "1.75 cup chicken broth ($0.23)",

Let the skillet simmer on low for 30 minutes. Make sure it is simmering the whole time (you should be able to hear it quietly simmer away). If it is not, turn the heat up slightly."

      "text": "After 30 minutes the rice should be tender and have absorbed all of the liquid. Turn off the heat, fluff the mixture, sprinkle the cheese on top, then return the lid to trap the residual heat and help the cheese melt. Slice the green onions while the cheese is melting, then sprinkle them on top and serve."
