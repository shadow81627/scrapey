Heat a frying pan, add 1 tablespoon of the oil and cook the fish for 2 minutes until lightly browned on the underside. Drizzle another tablespoon of the oil over the fish. Place the pan under a preheated hot grill, making sure you turn the handle away from the heat if not flameproof, and cook for 5-7 minutes until just cooked through. Mix together the remaining oil, vinegar and garlic."
