Remove cauliflower from the oven and add to a large bowl. Pour sauce over and mix until all the cauliflower is coated. Place back onto the sheet pan and back into the oven and bake for another 7-10 minutes. You can pour the sauce right over the sheet pan instead of transferring to a bowl, but I’ve found it’s easier to get a good coating by adding it to a bowl."
