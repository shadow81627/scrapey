Heat the oil and garlic over medium-low heat. Let the garlic sizzle in the oil for 1-2 minutes, or just until the garlic is slightly softened, but not brown. You just want to take the spicy raw bite off the garlic flavor. Remove the sauce pot from the heat and set it aside."

Taste the mashed potatoes and season to taste with salt and pepper. Remember, adding an adequate amount of salt will help the flavors pop. Serve warm."
