    "description": "Apple Custard Squares\n\nGet the WRITTEN RECIPE here - https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-apple-custard-squares/\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThese Vegan Apple Custard Squares have a shortbread-like base topped with apples, then creamy custard and cinnamon sugar on top. Use a pie pan to make Apple Custard Pie. \nThese custard bars came about when I had to use up some non dairy yogurt. The shortbready crust at the bottom is topped with apples and then topped with a tangy custard mixture which is sprinkled with cinnamon sugar and baked to make slices of custard bars with various flavors and textures!\n\nYou can use just cashew cream for the custard layer as well. Add some lemon zest for fresh zesty flavor. Change up the flavors to use winter spices such as gingerbread or pumpkin pie spice. Make this into a pie (use a pie pan and double the crust).\n\n******MORE DESSERT RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nVEGAN APPLE CINNAMON SCONES : https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-apple-cinnamon-scones-no-oil-low-fat/\n\nVEGAN APPLE CAKE WITH CINNAMON CUSTARD: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-apple-cake-with-cinnamon-custard/\n\nTRIPLE LAYER CHOCOLATE MOUSSE CAKE: https://www.veganricha.com/triple-layer-chocolate-mousse-cake/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#applecustardsquares #appledessert #vegandessert #veganricha #easyveganrecipes",
