  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1/2 cup fresh mint (divided)",
    "1 1/2 cups raw cashews (soaked for 8 hours, then drained)",
    "1 14-ounce can full-fat coconut milk (or other non-dairy milk, though full-fat coconut will yield creamiest result)",
    "1/2 - 3/4 tsp peppermint extract (depending on how minty you like it)",
    "1/4 cup cane sugar",
    "1/4 cup agave nectar or maple syrup (or honey if not vegan)",
    "3 Tbsp coconut oil (melted)",
    "1 tps vanilla extract (optional)",
    "1 cup packed dates (pitted // if your dates are dried out, soak them in warm water for 10 minutes to plump them back up then drain)",
    "1 1/4 cups raw walnuts (I used a mix of almonds and walnuts)",
    "1/3 cup cacao OR cocoa powder (though cocoa powder makes it not technically raw)"

      "text": "OPTIONAL STEP: When ready to prepare ice cream, steep HALF of your fresh mint leaves in the coconut milk. Bring the coconut milk to a simmer in a small saucepan and add the mint leaves, then turn to low. Use a wooden spoon or muddler to puncture the mint so it infuses the coconut milk. Keep on low for 15 minutes, then kill heat and let cool. Once cooled, strain out the mint leaves using a fine mesh strainer and pour the coconut milk right into a blender. (If not doing this step, just add all of the fresh mint and coconut milk right into the blender. The flavor won't be AS strong, but it will still be delicious.)"
