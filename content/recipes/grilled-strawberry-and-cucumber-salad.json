Add the strawberry skewers to the side that is now “off” and grill the strawberries over indirect heat for 10 minutes, rotating the skewers once halfway through the cooking time. The strawberries will be slightly soft and have a few grill marks on their surface. Add the cucumber slices to the side of the grill that is still “on” and grill over direct heat for 1-2 minutes per side, until slightly softened and starting to form a few grill marks. Remove the strawberry skewers and the cucumber slices from the grill, transferring them to a clean plate to cool."

Divide the salad between four bowls or plates. Top with the grilled strawberries (you can remove them from the skewers first, or leave them on for a nice presentation) and a wedge of blue cheese. Serve immediately."
