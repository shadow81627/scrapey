    "1/2 tsp poppy Seeds (, 1/3 tsp for less prominent flavor)",
    "1/8 tsp fennel seeds",
    "8 Saffron strands",
    "1/4 tsp dried rose petals (optional)",
    "3 tbsp rice flour (, I use white rice flour for neutral flavor)",
    "2.5 cups non dairy milk such as almond, soy or light coconut (, 2 cups for thicker pudding)",

The mixture will start to get lumpy, keep stirring frequently and the lumps will incorporate in the pudding. Once smooth, cook for another minute. Once the mixture is very lumpy, you can reduce the heat to medium low to avoid sticking. It takes 10 - 12 minutes total."
