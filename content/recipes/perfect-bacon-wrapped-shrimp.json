  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: Cook the bacon, wrap the shrimp, and refrigerate in an airtight container overnight. Heat a rimmed baking sheet under the broiler for about 10 minutes, then broil the shrimp on the baking sheet.Equipment: This recipe can also be done in an air fryer. Air fry the wrapped shrimp at 400℉ for 6 to 8 minutes. For crispy bacon, depending on the size of your air fryer, cook the shrimp in batches so as to not crowd out the shrimp (which will result in soggy bacon).Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days. Enjoy cold or at room temperature. Reheating the shrimp is not recommended, as the shrimp will become hard and rubbery.  "
