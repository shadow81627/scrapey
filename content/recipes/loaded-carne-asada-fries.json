  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Gluten-free: To make this dish gluten free, make sure the chipotles in adobo sauce do not contain wheat.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 3 days. To reheat, separate the carne asada from the fries. Reheat the meat first in the microwave until warmed through. Cover with a paper towel to keep warm while then reheating the fries in the microwave. This will help keep the fries from getting too soggy while reheating. "
