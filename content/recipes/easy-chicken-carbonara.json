Add the pancetta and cook, stirring occasionally, until just starting to brown, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the chicken and cook, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through and the pancetta is crisp, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat."

Coarsely chop a handful of parsley leaves for garnish if desired."
