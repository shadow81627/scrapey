If it appears too liquidy, add an additional 1 Tbsp (9 g // as recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) coconut flour. You're looking for a pourable liquid, but not too watery."

Depending on the temperature of your home, they may solidify at room temperature. If not, carefully transfer to the refrigerator until firm. Then remove from molds and enjoy. Because coconut butter chilled has some texture, don't be worried if the tops of your bars have a bit of ridging to them - that's totally normal!"
