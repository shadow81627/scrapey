Add the flour mixture and thyme to the sugar mixture and stir until just combined. Spoon the batter into the doughnut pans, approximately 3/4 of the way full. Bake for 15 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out clean when inserted into the center of the doughnuts. Let cool for 5 minutes and then invert onto a wire cooling rack until completely cool. Dip the tops of the cooled doughnuts in the glaze and add lemon zest and a sprig of thyme."
