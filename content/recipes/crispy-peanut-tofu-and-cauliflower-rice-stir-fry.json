    "12 ounces extra-firm tofu (organic & non-GMO if possible)",
    "2 1/2 Tbsp creamy peanut butter or almond butter",
    "1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil",
    "2 Tbsp tamari (or soy sauce if not gluten-free // or sub coconut aminos but use more as it's less salty)",
    "2 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "1-2 tsp chili garlic sauce",
    "1 small head cauliflower",
    "2 cloves garlic (minced // 2 cloves yield ~1 Tbsp or 6 g)",
    "1-2 tsp tamari (or soy sauce if not gluten-free // or sub coconut aminos but use more as it's less salty)",
    "1 cup thinly sliced baby bok choy, green onion, red pepper, or broccoli",

      "text": "Once pressed, slice tofu into roughly 1/2-inch cubes and arrange on the parchment-lined baking sheet in a single layer. Ensure they aren't touching so they will crisp up. Bake for 20-25 minutes to dry/firm the tofu. NOTE: At 20 minutes, the tofu should be chewy, and at 25 minutes, the tofu should be more crispy. Bake according to preference."
