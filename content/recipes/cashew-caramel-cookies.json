    "2 sticks unsalted butter (8 ounces/226 grams)",

    "1 1/3 cups packed light brown sugar (267 grams)",
    "1/3 cup granulated sugar (67 grams)",
    "2 large eggs",
    "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
    "3 cups spooned and leveled all-purpose flour (384 grams)",

(Depending on the brand and freshness of your caramel candies, they might be too firm to press together. If so, arrange the caramels in a single layer on a large microwave-safe plate and microwave for 30 seconds until the caramels are warm but not melting. If you accidently microwave them too long and they start to melt, just let them cool for a few minutes.)"

Flatten the balls slightly and press a caramel ball into the center of each one. Tightly form the dough around the caramel and reroll into a ball again. Make sure there are no cracks so the caramel does not ooze out during baking. Place the dough balls 3 inches apart on the baking sheets (6 to 8 per sheet)."

Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for at least 30 minutes before moving. (If you try to pick up the cookies while still hot, the caramel will fall out—and potentially burn you—so be patient.)"
