Cut the tempeh in half width-wise and then again down the middle so that you have 4 thin squares. Submerge them in the marinade and marinate for at least 30 minutes. Once the tempeh is marinated, cut it into 1/2\" strips. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add tempeh and cook for 5 minutes, or until blackened. Add excess marinade and continue cooking until all the marinade has cooked off. Set aside to cool."
