    "400g fresh chanterelle mushrooms, sliced",
    "4 tsp olive oil",
    "2-3 cloves garlic, crushed",
    "5 tbs soured cream",
    "1-2 small chillies, deseeded and finely chopped",

      "text": "Place the mushrooms in a saucepan and dry-fry them over a low heat, shaking the pan gently, until their juices run. Then, turn the heat up so the liquid evaporates and the mushrooms are soft, but reasonably dry. Add 3 teaspoons of the olive oil to coat the mushrooms, then add the garlic, chillies, and soured cream, and let the mixture simmer over a low heat for 2-6 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper to taste."

      "text": "Meanwhile, cook the pasta according to the packet instructions until it is al dente, adding the last teaspoon of olive oil to the cooking water to prevent it boiling over and to enhance the flavour of the pasta. Drain and transfer to a warmed serving dish. Spoon the sauce over the pasta, garnish with the parsley, combine the ingredients well, and serve with a green salad."
