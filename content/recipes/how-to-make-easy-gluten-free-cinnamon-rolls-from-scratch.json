    "text": "Storage: Cinnamon buns are best eaten immediately after baking. Make ahead: Cinnamon buns can be made up to 24 hours in advance. Arrange the buns in a baking dish, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate. Remove from the refrigerator 1 hour before baking, brush with melted butter, and then bake as instructed above. Alternatiely, freeze the buns on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Once frozen transfer to a zip-top freezer bag and freeze for up to 2 weeks. Transfer buns to the cake pan, thaw in the refrigerator overnight, then remove from the fridge 1 hour before baking according to instructions above. "
