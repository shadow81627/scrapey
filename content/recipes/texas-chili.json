    "text": "Non-alcoholic: You can substitute 1 1/2 cups low-sodium beef broth for the beer. Add a splash of white vinegar when the chili is ready.Equipment:If you have a 5-quart Dutch oven, sear the meat in 4 to 5 batches. If you have a very large Dutch oven, such as a 7-quart, you can sear the beef in 2 batches.You can use a food processor instead of a blender to make the chile mixture. Process the chiles and garlic first until chopped, then add in the cooking liquid and continuing processing until smooth.Make ahead: The chili can be made up to 3 days ahead and refrigerated. Reheat over medium heat, adding a splash of water or beef broth as needed.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days or frozen for up to 3 months. Thaw overnight before reheating."
