Pour the crumb mixture into the pan then spread the crumbs evenly and press them down firmly. Bake for 6 - 8 minutes until the edges are lightly golden. Remove from oven but leave the oven on."

      "text": "To make the vegan pumpkin cheesecake: add all of the ingredients to a food processor or blender and blend until as smooth as possible stopping to scrape the sides as needed. The smoother you can get it, the better. I tried both the food processor and blender and didn't have a preference for either. The key was just to keep blending for a looong time. You want this baby smooth!"

      "text": "Pour the mixture over top of the cookie crust and spread evenly. Bake for 25 - 35 minutes until the edges look dry and begin to crack. Let cool at room temperature, then transfer to the fridge and allow to chill uncovered for a minimum of 4 hours or overnight until set. Please note that your cheesecake may come out lighter or darker in color. This is just due to the pumpkin you use, and will taste perfect either way!"
