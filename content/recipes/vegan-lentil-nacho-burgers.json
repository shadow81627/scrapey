Lower heat and allow to simmer, uncovered, for about 25 minutes, until the lentils are just shy of being fully cooked and still a tiny bit firm at their centers. Add water to the pot during cooking if it all dries up. Once finished cooking, drain any excess water and set the lentils aside to coll while you prep the remaining ingredients."

Dig in with your hands and mix everything up. Test the mixture by pressing some together in your hands. If it seems too squishy and doesn't hold together, add a bit more panko and try mashing a small portion of the lentils with a fork."

Avoid crowding the skillet, and work in batches if needed, adding oil to the skillet as needed between batches. Cook each patty until browned on the bottom, about 4 to 5 minutes. Carefully flip and cook 4 to 5 minutes more, until browned on the other side."
