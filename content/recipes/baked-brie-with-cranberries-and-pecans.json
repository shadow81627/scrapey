  "description": "If you've never made baked brie before today, you are in for a real treat. Our addition of cranberries and pecans makes this a wonderful entertaining appetizer that's perfect for any time of year. \r\nThe tart fruit and the crunch of the nuts contrast perfectly with the rich, earthy flavor of a buttery warm brie. ",
