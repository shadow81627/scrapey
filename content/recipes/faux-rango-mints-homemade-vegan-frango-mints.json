      "text": "Line a small baking dish with parchment paper (I use a 7x5-inch dish). Pour the chocolate mixture into the dish and use a spatula to smooth the top. Place the dish in the refrigerator and chill for 2-3 hours, until the chocolate is solid. Remove the parchment and use a knife to trim any uneven edges from the chocolate, then cut it into 24 squares. Place the squares on a large plate that's been lined with parchment paper, cover it with foil or plastic wrap, and freeze for at least 8 hours."

      "text": "Place the chopped dark chocolate in a small microwave-safe bowl and microwave 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each interval, until it's melted (or use a double-boiler to melt it on the stovetop). Take the chocolate centers out of the freezer; one at a time, place them on a fork and dip them into the melted chocolate to coat, working quickly to make sure the centers don't melt. Let any excess chocolate drip off and carefully transfer each square back to the parchment paper-lined plate. Sprinkle the broken candy cane pieces on top, while the chocolate is still wet (it will solidify quickly!). Once all of the chocolates are dipped, refrigerate them for at least an hour before serving. Store in the refrigerator in a covered container; the mints can be served at room temperature for melty centers or chilled for more solid centers."
