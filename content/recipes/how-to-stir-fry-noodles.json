    "text": "Stir-fried noodles in a skillet: A wok is preferred over a skillet for this recipe because the amount of ingredients can make stir-frying in a skillet tricky. If you use a skillet, stir-fry the meat and vegetables on their own, transfer them to a plate, then stir-fry the noodles and the sauce. Mix everything together at the end, working in batches if necessary.Stir fry sauce: Grace Young&#x27;s favorite simple sauce for these noodles is a mix of 1 tablespoon of soy sauce and 1 tablespoon rice wine or dry sherry. You could also add a tablespoon of oyster sauce or chili garlic sauce."
