      "text": "Top muffins with eggs and spoon over hollandaise sauce. Serve with roasted roma tomatoes and baby spinach. Tip 1: If you think your sauce is about to curdle but not scramble, immediately remove from heat and whisk in a cube of ice. Or you can remove sauce from heat and place 1 teaspoon lemon juice, 1 egg yolk and 1 tablespoon of the curdled sauce in a medium heatproof bowl. Whisk over over the pan of barely simmering water until the mixture combines and thickens and the emulsion is reformed, then whisk in the remaining sauce in a slow steady stream until combined. Tip 2: Hollandaise sauce also goes well with grilled fish or steak."
