Spread the batter a bit with the ladle if needed. Cover the pan for 2 minutes. Remove cover and continue for another 2 or so minutes until the top is bubbly. Flip and cook for another 2-3 minutes. Reduce head a bit to low-medium while cooking if the pan gets too hot. Or use your favorite pancake mix recipe, and adjust liquid accordingly."
