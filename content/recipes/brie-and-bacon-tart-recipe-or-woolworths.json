      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface, and use to line the tart tin, letting the pastry hang over the edges. Trim away the excess, line the pastry shell with greaseproof paper, and fill with ceramic baking beans. Bake in the oven for about 20 minutes until the edges are golden. Remove the beans and paper, brush the bottom of the shell with a little egg wash, and return to the oven for 1-2 minutes to crisp. Remove from the oven, and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C."
