Nourishing ingredients, BIG flavor, a hearty plant-based meal.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/black-bean-buddha-bowl-with-gingery-lemon-tahini-sauce/\n\nIt’s not clear where the term Buddha Bowl originated, but some say the concept is thought to emulate the way buddhist monks would walk around with a bowl, accepting small portions from other people. While others claim that Buddha bowls refer to a healthy, balanced, but overloaded bowl resembling the rounded belly of the Laughing Buddha. Either way, Buddha bowls are one of our absolute favorite meals!\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
