      "text": "Preheat the oven to 200°C. Roll out the pastry on a floured work surface, and use to line the tart tin. Trim away the excess, line the pastry shell with greaseproof paper, and fill with ceramic baking beans. Bake in the oven for 1520 minutes until the edges of the pastry are golden. Remove the beans and paper, brush the bottom of the pastry shell with a little of the beaten egg, and return to the oven for 2-3 minutes to crisp. Remove from the oven, and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C."

Add the garlic, squash, and half of the thyme leaves, and continue cooking over a low heat for 1015 minutes until the squash softens and begins to turn golden. You may have to add a little more oil."

Leave to cool for at least 10 minutes before releasing from the tin. Serve warm with a rocket salad."
