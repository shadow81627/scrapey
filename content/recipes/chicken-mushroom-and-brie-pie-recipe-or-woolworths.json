Make several incisions the pastry lid with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape. Use the beaten egg to wash the pie lid, then place the pie dish into the preheated oven. Bake for 25 minutes or until the pastry is golden brown."

You can have it as a full meal with chips and salad or vegetables, cut it up into smaller pieces and use on a Ploughmans sharing or grazing platter, and makes an ideal picnic meal. This pie will also freeze well. Mangiare, enjoy."
