      "text": "When the pan is hot pour the batter into the pan in rounds, leaving at least an inch of space around each one because they do expand a bit and you also need to be able to get in there easily to flip them when they are ready too. To keep them all the same size use a ladle or a measuring cup. 1/3 of a cup per pancake is a nice amount for a decent sized pancake but you could use 1/4 cup to make them smaller."
