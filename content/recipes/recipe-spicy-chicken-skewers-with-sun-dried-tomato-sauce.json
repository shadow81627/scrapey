After 5 minutes, flip the skewers and brush the other side with the basting sauce; cover. Continue cooking, turning if necessary, until chicken is cooked through, about 12 to 15 minutes total. (To check for doneness, cut into a piece with a thin-bladed knife; the center should be white or slightly pink.)"
