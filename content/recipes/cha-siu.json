Pierce the slabs all over with a fork at about 1/2-inch intervals, poking all the way through. Season the pork all over with 2 teaspoons kosher salt.

Roast for 1 hour, brushing the pork all over with a thin layer of glaze and flipping the slabs every 15 minutes. The cha siu should be tender, charred at the edges, and have an internal temperature of at least 155oF in the thickest part (higher is fine). If it starts to char too much before the roasting time is up, tent loosely with foil. If it is not charred enough, broil as needed after 1 hour roasting time, checking every minute or so."

If not serving all the pork immediately, only slice what you will be eating and leave the remainder unsliced to keep it from drying out."
