Spoon the dough into a piping bag, then squeeze 5 cm lengths into the oil, cutting off the ends with scissors - only cook 5 at a time. Deep-fry for about 3 minutes until golden, then remove with a slotted spoon. Drain on kitchen paper and keep warm while you cook the remaining dough. Sprinkle the churros with the caster sugar. Serve the warm churros with the chocolate custard in small serving dishes on the side for dunking."
