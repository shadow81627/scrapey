Cut the head from the tentacles and discard, making sure that the tentacles remain attached as one. Cut or pull out the small beak from inside the tentacles. Pull out and discard the strip of transparent cartilage from inside the body, and rinse the body (the thin outer skin should peel away) and tentacles thoroughly. Pat dry with kitchen paper."

Grill the squid bodies and tentacles over a high heat for 1–2 minutes, turning halfway through cooking, until lightly charred on all sides. Remove to a chopping board. Cut the tentacle clusters in half crossways, and put in a bowl. Slice the tubes into 3mm rings, slicing through the wings as you go, and put in the bowl with the tentacles."
