    "description": "A good lasagna should have al-dente noodles that are crisp at the edges yet tender enough to cut with a fork; a simmered-all-day meaty Bolognese sauce; a creamy layer of ricotta peeking from between the layers, mellowing the sharpness of the tomatoes; and cheese, browned and golden on top but gooey throughout. Special occasions call for devoting a weekend to this classic dish, but it is possible to hit the high points with a few smart shortcuts. This is real-life lasagna — the lasagna you make when you have a full pantry but are short on time.",
