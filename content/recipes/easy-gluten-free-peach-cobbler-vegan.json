    "4 cups thinly sliced fresh peaches, cut into 1/2-inch slices",
    "2 Tbsp arrowroot starch (or sub cornstarch)",
    "1/3 cup cane sugar (or coconut sugar)",
    "1 - 1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "3/4 cup almond flour (or sub finely ground cashews or another nut or seed flour)",
    "3/4 cup potato starch (or sub all-purpose GF flour blend, but biscuits will be slightly more gummy)",
    "1/4 cup cane sugar (or sub coconut sugar, but the biscuits will be brown)",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1 tsp baking powder",
    "3 Tbsp solid* refined coconut oil (or sub chilled butter)",
    "1/4 cup cold water or dairy-free milk",

Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the arrowroot (or cornstarch), sugar, and cinnamon. Stir and cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring frequently, until the peaches are tender and the liquid is very thick and saucy. Transfer the peach mixture to the 8x8-inch baking dish and set aside."

Then place the cobbler on the middle rack and bake for 30-40 minutes. The fruit should be bubbling and the cobbler biscuits golden brown. Let cool for at least 10 minutes before serving to help the fruit thicken."
