Heat the milk in a pan until almost boiling, then slowly whisk into the egg mixture with the lemon juice. Return the mixture to the pan and slowly bring to the boil, stirring continuously. Cook for a couple of minutes, then transfer to a bowl. Sit a piece of greaseproof paper on the surface so the custard doesn’t form a skin, then leave to cool."

      "text": "Meanwhile, on a lightly floured surface, roll the pastry out into a 23 × 30cm rectangle and place on a lightly oiled baking sheet. With a knife, score a rectangle on it, leaving a 2cm border all round the edge. Press the back of the knife into the border to make horizontal lines - these will ensure the pastry rises. Prick the base of the rectangle with a fork and place in the refrigerator for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 200°C (Gas 6)."
