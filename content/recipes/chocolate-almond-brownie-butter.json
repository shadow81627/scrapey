It's ok if they are still warm when you process them, but if they are too hot they can damage your food processor. (I learned this this hard way)."

      "text": "When the almonds are cooled add them to the food processor and start grinding. Keep blending! They will grind to a powder, then that powder will start to thicken, then it will start to ball up, then it will relax and look like almond butter, but you aren't done yet! Keep blending until the oils are released and it becomes shiny. Congrats, you just made almond butter! This process can take anywhere from 5 to 15 minutes so be patient! It will eventually get there."

      "text": "Now add the cocoa powder, salt, vanilla extract, powdered sugar, and 1/2 cup of water. Blend to incorporate. Add 2 tablespoons more water at a time until the desired consistency is reached. I found that 4 more tablespoons was perfect for me. You just don't want to add too much right away, because you can't take it back, so better to go slow here."
