      "text": "Put a layer of the potatoes in the bottom of a 2.3 L flameproof dish, lay the chops on top, and season well with salt and black pepper. Heat the remaining oil in the frying pan, add the onions, and cook over a low heat, stirring frequently, for 10 minutes, or until beginning to soften. Stir in the anchovies. Spoon a layer of the onion mixture on top of the chops, then add the rest of the potatoes and the onion mixture in layers, finishing with one of potato."

Dot the potatoes with butter, cover the dish tightly with foil, then put in the oven to cook for 2 hours, or until the potatoes are meltingly soft and the stock has been absorbed. Remove the foil for the last 20 minutes of cooking. Serve with pickled red cabbage."
