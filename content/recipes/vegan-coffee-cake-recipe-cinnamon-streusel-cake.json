    "description": "Easy Vegan Coffee Cake Recipe. Simple soft Vanilla Cake topped with a delicious Streusel. GF option\nFULL RECIPE : https://www.veganricha.com/2018/08/vegan-coffee-cake-recipe.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nThis is an Easy and decadent Classic Cinnamon Streusel Coffee cake. The smooth cake batter comes together quickly. It is topped with a simple cinnamon streusel that bakes up beautifully. Use other spices in the streusel for variation. Add nuts or fresh or dried fruit to the batter and streusel. \n\nThis Coffee Cake is just the right decadent, and just enough sweet to stand as a bakery version without going overly sweet. It is amazing as is. Add a simple icing for events and such. Gluten-free option on the post. \n\nMusic: Pryces x Jef : Mornings\n\n\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ \n\nHi, I'm Richa!
