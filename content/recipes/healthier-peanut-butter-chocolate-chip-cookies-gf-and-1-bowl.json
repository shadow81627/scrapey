    "1/4 cup rolled oats (ensure gluten-free friendly as needed)",
    "1/4 cup gluten-free flour (or sub other flour, such as almond or unbleached all-purpose)",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt (plus more for topping)",
    "1/2 tsp baking powder",
    "1/2 cup brown sugar (or try subbing coconut sugar, but we only tested with brown)",
    "1/2 cup creamy salted peanut butter (we like Wild Friends — ingredients should only be peanuts and salt)",
    "1/2 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1 large egg (organic, pasture-raised when possible)",
    "3 Tbsp dark chocolate chips (dairy-free), chopped (plus more for topping)"

      "text": "Add peanut butter (ensure it’s natural and pourable — just peanuts and salt), vanilla, and egg and stir until a tacky dough is formed. Depending on the freshness / drippiness of your peanut butter, you may need to add a little more GF flour if it’s too wet. Or, if it’s too dry or crumbly, compensate with a bit more peanut butter (or a splash of dairy-free milk). We found ours didn't need any adjustments."
