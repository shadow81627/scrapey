Otherwise, freeze until solid, then transfer to a plastic zip-top bag and freeze for up to 2 months. Cook from frozen, adding 2 minutes to the cooking time. The broth can also be frozen for up to 2 months.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days."

Pull the two bottom corners over the center until they meet, then dab with a little water so they stick together and the wonton resembles a nurse’s cap.

    "description": "I am a firm believer in the power of dumplings and soup. Not only is the combination tasty and comforting, but a little upfront effort also yields prepped emergency meals to stash in my freezer — and who doesn't want that? These easy wontons are full of juicy, savory ground pork and swim in a 15-minute gingery broth that starts with boxed chicken broth. Best of all, the ingredients are all easy-to-find, and the wontons use a simple but pretty wrapping technique.\n\nSee the full recipe post here: https://www.thekitchn.com/wonton-soup-265099",
