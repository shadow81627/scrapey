    "description": "Instant Pot Lasagna Soup – 1 Pot Meal. Saucepan option.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/02/instant-pot-lasagna-soup-vegan.html\n\nVegan Lasagna Soup with lasagna noodles, veggies, red lentils and basil. 1 Pot weekday meal. Vegan Nut-free Recipe. Saucepan option Can be gluten-free. Serve with pesto, vegan ricotta or garlic bread.\n\n\nThis soup is satisfying and comfort food made in 1 pot and ready within minutes. It comes together quickly with short active time. Make it in the Instant Pot (pressure cooker) or a Saucepan (see recipe notes on post), but definitely make it. I love the soup with some extra garlicky topping like garlic bread or garlic olive oil and some fresh basil or pesto. Lentils make up the protein. If using brown lentils, use cooked lentils. Veggie crumbles will also work wonderfully.\n\n\nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: Me too by Lakey inspired \nhttps://soundcloud.com/lakeyinspired/",
