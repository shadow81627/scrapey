  "description": "For this Hummus and Grilled Vegetable PizzaÂ recipe, we marinated zucchini, yellow squash and Japanese eggplant in olive, lemon, garlic, coriander, cumin and ginger, and threw them on the grill till tender. We spread our homemade hummus over store bough crust instead of cheese for a healthier twist and a boost of protein (need a shortcut? Store bought hummus works just fine!)",
