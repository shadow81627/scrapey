Heat gently, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved, then boil rapidly for about 15 minutes until setting point is reached. Check with a candy thermometer or spoon a little of the jelly onto a saucer that has been chilled in the refrigerator. Leave for 1-2 minutes, then run a finger through the jelly. If a finger space is left and the jelly has wrinkled it is ready; if not boil for 5-10 minutes more and then retest."
