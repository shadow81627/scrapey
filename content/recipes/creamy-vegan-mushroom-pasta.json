You will struggle to fit it all in the pan but squish it down and it will melt down to more manageable levels very quickly. Season them with a pinch of salt and pepper. Turn the heat down to medium low."

Stir everything together really well. Check the seasoning and add more salt and pepper if necessary. Allow it to warm through over the heat, adding a little of the reserved starchy water if you want to thin the sauce a little. You shouldn't need much, if any at all."
