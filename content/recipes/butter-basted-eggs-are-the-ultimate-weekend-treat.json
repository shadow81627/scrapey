As the eggs cook, carefully tilt the pan toward you so that the butter puddles towards the edge, then use a spoon to baste the hot butter over the egg whites (avoid the egg yolks unless you like a firmer, more set eggâ€”in which case, spoon butter over the yolk too). Baste until no jiggly white remains, 2 to 3 minutes."

Place the pan back on the stove over medium heat and continue to cook the butter until it becomes deeply golden and nutty-smelling, about 2 minutes more. Pour the browned butter over the eggs."
