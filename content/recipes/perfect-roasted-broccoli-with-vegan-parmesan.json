      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Optional: For more tender and easier to digest broccoli our preferred method is to lightly steam it first. To steam the broccoli, place a steamer basket in a large pot. Fill the pot with at least 1/4-inch of water, but not so much that it touches the bottom of the steamer basket. Bring water to a boil, then add broccoli florets to the steamer basket and cook for 2-4 minutes or until bright green and just tender enough to pierce with a fork. Remove from the pot and set aside until cool enough to handle."

      "text": "To the parchment-lined baking sheet, add (raw or steamed) broccoli florets. Drizzle with oil then sprinkle with vegan parmesan cheese, salt, and garlic (optional). Toss to evenly coat the broccoli, making sure each floret is laying on its flattest side and no florets are overlapping."
