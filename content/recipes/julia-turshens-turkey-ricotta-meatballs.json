    "text": "Reprinted from Small Victories by Julia Turshen with permission by Chronicle Books, 2016.For sausage and ricotta meatballs, instead of ground turkey, use 2 pounds of your favorite sausage meat. Just take it out of its casings and proceed as directed. I like using half sweet and half spicy Italian sausage.For a slightly Moroccan riff, use ground lamb instead of turkey and finely crumbled feta instead of Parmesan. Leave out the ricotta. Add a handful each of toasted pine nuts and raisins to the mixture, and use mint instead of basil. Add a cinnamon stick to the tomato sauce (remove it before serving the meatballs)."

    "2 (28-ounce) cans whole peeled tomatoes",
    "7 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil",
    "7 garlic cloves; 4 thinly sliced, 3 minced",
    "Kosher salt",
    "1 cup fresh basil leaves, finely chopped",
    "1 cup fresh Italian parsley leaves, finely chopped",
    "1 1/2 cups fresh whole milk ricotta cheese",

      "text": "Pour the contents of the tomato cans into a large bowl (set the cans aside) and crush the tomatoes with your hands (this is a messy but fun job, and a very good one for children). Rinse one of the cans with about 1/4 cup water, pour it into the second can and swish it around to get all the excess tomato out of the cans, and then pour the water into the tomato bowl."

      "text": "In a large saucepan or pot over medium-high heat, warm 3 tablespoons of the olive oil, add the sliced garlic, and cook, stirring, until it begins to sizzle, about 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and a very large pinch of salt and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and let the sauce simmer, stirring every so often, until it is slightly reduced and has lost any tin-can taste, about 30 minutes."

      "text": "In a large bowl, combine the minced garlic, basil, parsley, ricotta, Parmesan, turkey, and 1 tablespoon salt. Blend everything together gently but authoritatively with your hands (they’re the best tool for the job) until well mixed. Then, use your hands to form the mixture into golf ball–sized meatballs; the mixture will be sticky, so wet your hands with a bit of water to help prevent the meat from sticking to them. Transfer the meatballs to the prepared baking sheet as you form them (it’s okay if they are touching a little). Drizzle the meatballs with the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil and roast until they’re browned and firm to the touch, about 25 minutes."
