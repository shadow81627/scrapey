    "text": "If you have leftover caramel and want to add a second layer on the apples after they&#x27;ve cooled, warm the caramel over low heat, stirring occasionally just until it&#x27;s soft. Then dip the apples again, allowing any excess caramel to drip off, and refrigerate until set.Store the caramel apples on a plate or baking sheet, covered with plastic wrap, in the refrigerator for 3 to 4 days."

      "text": "Combine and cook the sugar, corn syrup, and water: Combine the sugar, corn syrup, and water in a large saucepan, and stir so the sugar is evenly moistened. Over medium-high heat, bring the sugar syrup to a boil without stirring. Continue cooking until an instant-read or candy thermometer reads 320°F for a lighter caramel coating, or up to 350°F for a dark caramel coating. Around this time, the sugar will begin to darken and take on a caramel aroma. If necessary, tilt the pan slightly so the thermometer is submerged enough to get an accurate reading. The sugar syrup will significantly grow in size in the next step, so it's important that you do not substitute a smaller saucepan."
