    "description": "What are apple dumplings? Think of them as bite-sized versions of apple pie (only better), with all the goodness of a flaky crust and gooey apple filling. Many are made with whole apples, but the ones I'm hooked on are made with diced apples, which make them super easy to eat. I love picking some up from a local farm stand as a treat for my family and, no matter what, I always eat one straight away. They're that good! And because they're so small, I can eat another one (or two) later and not feel guilty. Although apple dumplings have become synonymous with the Pennsylvania Dutch, they feel right at home in the Catskills and the Hudson Valley, especially since we're surrounded by orchards on all sides. These areas were settled by the Dutch, too, who likely used fattened milk and flour pastry to enclose apples and raisins, sweetened with sugar, as a breakfast item or dessert.",
