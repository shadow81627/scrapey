Wash the carrot tops well as they are sometimes quite sandy, and discard any brown bits. I used 1 cup packed of carrot top greens, but a little more or a little less will not make much of a difference."

If your pesto is a bit too thick, add a splash of water or more olive oil until you reach the desired consistency. Use the pesto right away or store it in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 5 days or you can freeze it."
