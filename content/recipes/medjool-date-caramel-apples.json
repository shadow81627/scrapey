If you don't want any toppings, you can smooth the caramel down by wetting your fingers and lightly rubbing away any bumps. This is just for look and is optional. If you want to use toppings, you can skip that step and just roll the caramel apples into toppings of choice. Drizzle melted chocolate on top for extra glam."
