    "6 large eggs",
    "1 (16-ounce) can or jar pickled beets",
    "1 cup apple cider vinegar",
    "1/3 cup packed brown sugar",
    "1 tablespoon whole peppercorns (I used fiery pink peppercorns)",
    "1 teaspoon salt, plus more as needed",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 tablespoon mayonnaise",
    "1 tablespoon distilled white vinegar",

      "text": "To prepare the brine, pour a can of pickled beets into a large bowl. Add the cider vinegar, sugar, peppercorns, and salt, and stir to combine. Carefully (that beet juice will stain!) place the peeled eggs into the brine. Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or up to 3 days. The longer you leave them in the brine, the more sour and pink they'll end up. I like just the rim of pink and slight pickled flavor, so I let mine sit about 16 hours."

      "text": "When brining time is finished, remove the egss from the brine. Cut each egg in half from top to bottom. Scoop out the yolks and place in a medium bowl. Add the olive oil, mayonnaise, white vinegar, mustard, and curry powder. Mix and mash with a fork until smooth. Add a little bit of water to the mixture if it's too stiff. Taste and season with salt and pepper as needed."
