Using fingertips, rub in butter until mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in chives and three-quarters of the cheese. Using a butter knife, stir in milk and mix to a soft dough. Turn out on a lightly floured surface and knead lightly until dough is almost smooth. Press out until 3cm thick. Using a 4cm plain cutter, cut out 12 rounds. Place scones on tray, brush with extra milk and scatter over remaining cheese. Bake for 20 minutes or until scones are golden. Serve chowder with scones."
