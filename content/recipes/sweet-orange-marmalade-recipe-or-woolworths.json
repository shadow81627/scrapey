Seal and label. Note: Leaving the pith on the peel can make the marmalade cloudy, although it will not overly affect the flavour. Tip 1: Use a sugar thermometer and cook marmalade until 105°C is reached. Or, place 2 teaspoon of the marmalade onto a saucer and chill in the fridge for 23 minutes. Drag your finger through the marmalade; if it remains separated and has a wrinkled appearance, then it's ready. Tip 2: To sterilise jars and lids, wash in hot soapy water. Rinse well and drain upside down on a clean tea towel. Place into a cold oven and heat to 110°C. Turn off the oven and leave jars in for at least 10 minutes."
