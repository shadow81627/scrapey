    "1/4 cup maple syrup",
    "1/4 cup coconut sugar or other sugar of choice (use 1 tbsp less for less sweet)",
    "2 Tbsp oil (or use applesauce or aquafaba)",
    "1/2 to 1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1/2 tsp cinnamon",
    "1/2 cup flour (I use spelt or unbleached white. Use certified gf oat flour to make these gluten-free)",
    "1/2 tsp baking powder",
    "1/8 tsp salt",
    "1/4 cup almond meal",
    "1 cup old fashioned oats",
    "1/3 to 1/2 cup vegan chocolate chunks",

(add a bit less or more oats depending on the wet mixture. measurements vary and you want the mixture to be soft somewhat sticky). Add in the chocolate chunks and walnuts. Fold in to distribute evenly. The dough will be somewhat sticky. (Add more flour of too wet, or a dash of non dairy milk if too dry). I added 2 tbsp mini chocolate chips as well for some extra chocolate per bite."
