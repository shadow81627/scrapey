    "1/2 tsp sea salt, divided",
    "1 tsp ground cumin, divided",
    "1 tsp smoked paprika, divided",
    "1 tsp chili powder (, divided (NOT cayenne or just ground chilies — see notes*)",
    "1 Tbsp avocado oil (or other neutral oil, or sub water)",
    "2 (~8 ounce) chicken breasts*, boneless skinless (and organic, pasture-raised when possible)",
    "1 chipotle pepper in adobo sauce (omit or reduce for less heat)",
    "1/4 cup vegetable or chicken broth",
    "2 Tbsp lime juice",
    "Fresh cilantro",
    "White rice"

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "While the pan is heating, add half of the salt, cumin, paprika, and chili powder to one side of the chicken breasts so it’s evenly coated. There should be plenty of spices and you should barely be able to see the meat."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Flip the chicken again and lower heat to low. Top with a lid but leave it slightly off-center/cracked so steam can escape. Cook until the center of chicken reaches 165 degrees F (74 C) — about 8-10 minutes."

      "text": "You can flip the chicken a couple more times, but we find once to be enough if you lower the heat adequately (to ensure the underside doesn’t burn)."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once the chicken is cooked, turn off the heat and use two forks to shred the chicken into bite-size pieces (go as finely shredded as you desire). Then add the chipotle pepper in adobo sauce, vegetable broth, and lime juice. Stir to combine."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Turn heat back to low and cover. Simmer the mixture for 5-8 minutes, stirring occasionally to blend the flavors. Then turn off heat and enjoy. This would be ideal for burritos, burrito bowls, tacos, enchiladas, salads, and more! You could also just serve alongside rice and garnish with cilantro."

      "text": "Store cooled leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days (assuming your chicken was fresh), or in the freezer up to 1 month. Reheat on the stovetop and rehydrate with vegetable / chicken broth or water as needed."
