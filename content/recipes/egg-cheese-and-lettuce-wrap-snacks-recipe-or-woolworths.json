Add extra egg, honey and milk and mix until well combined. Stir in flour until just combined (do not over-mix). Divide mixture among holes. Press sultanas into top of each muffin to make eyes and a nose (place sultanas quite close together, as muffins expand during baking). Bake for 15 minutes or until golden and just firm. Set aside to cool for 5 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Makes 9. Pack 1 muffin in an airtight container. Freeze remaining muffins until required."
