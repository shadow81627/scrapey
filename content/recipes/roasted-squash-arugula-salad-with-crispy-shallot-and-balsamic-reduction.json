    "1 medium acorn squash (or similar winter squash // pick one with green and orange skin)",
    "1 Tbsp avocado or olive oil",
    "1 pinch each salt and black pepper",
    "1 cup balsamic vinegar",
    "2 medium shallots (thinly sliced)",
    "3 Tbsp brown rice flour",
    "1/8 tsp each sea salt",
    "~2 Tbsp olive oil or avocado oil (for cooking - if avoiding oil, omit and use a non-stick pan)",
    "1/4 cup macadamia nut cheese (or similar store-bought)",
    "2 Tbsp roasted or raw pepitas (we preferred roasted)",
    "5-6 cups arugula",
    "2 Tbsp dried currants (or other dried fruit, such as cranberries)"

Then allow to simmer until it is reduced by half and looks thick (about 10-15 minutes). Watch carefully near the end as it can go from reduced to burnt quickly. You’ll know it’s done when, swirled, it coats the sides of the pan."
