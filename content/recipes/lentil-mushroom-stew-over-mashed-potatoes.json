    "1 pound yellow potatoes, peeled and quartered evenly (I left on some skin for texture)",
    "Sea salt + black pepper to taste",
    "1-2 Tbsp olive oil (if avoiding oil, add more almond milk or vegetable broth)",
    "2-4 Tbsp unsweetened almond milk or vegetable broth (for added moisture)",
    "1 Tbsp water (or avocado or olive oil)",
    "1/2 cup chopped shallot",
    "2 cups sliced cremini (or button) mushrooms",
    "1-2 Tbsp coconut aminos",
    "1 pinch each salt and pepper",
    "2 Tbsp chopped fresh thyme (or sub rosemary // use dried if fresh is unavailable)",
    "2/3 cup dry green lentils (rinsed + drained // optional: soak overnight in cool water to improve digestibility)",
    "2-3 cups vegetable broth (or store-bought)",
    "1 Tbsp tomato paste (optional)",
    "2 Tbsp mashed potatoes (recipe above // for thickness)",
    "Fresh chopped parsley",
    "Vegan Parmesan Cheese"
