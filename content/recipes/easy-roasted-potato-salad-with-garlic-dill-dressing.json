  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 1/2 lbs potatoes (we like half Yukon gold and half sweet potatoes)",
    "2 Tbsp avocado oil",
    "1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper",
    "1/3 cup hummus (or store-bought)",
    "1-2 Tbsp lemon juice",
    "1 tsp dried dill (or 1 Tbsp fresh minced dill / amount as recipe is written — adjust as needed)",
    "3 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "3 Tbsp water (as needed to thin)",
    "1 pinch sea salt (optional)"
