      "text": "When the halloumi is golden brown on both sides, turn the heat down to low and drizzle the honey and lemon sauce into the pan to coat the cheese slices. Cook for a further 2 minutes each side. The halloumi will take on a deeper caramel colour when the honey infuses with the warm cheese. I used raw honey and the depth of colour, not to mention flavour was amazing. Enjoy."

      "text": "If you enjoy a less sweet more 'tart' flavour add more lemon juice. I taste the sauce as I go to make sure I get the right balance for us, it's really a matter of individual taste. Some other ingredients that I've tried and have worked well are: lime, orange or mandarin zest and juice in place of the lemon; smoked paprika, oregano or rosemary as a substitute for the thyme; or just simply, cracked black pepper and a sprinkle of Himalayan pink salt."
