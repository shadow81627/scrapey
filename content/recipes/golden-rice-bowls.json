      "text": "Begin the rice first because it will take the longest to cook. Dice the onion and mince the garlic. Saute onion and garlic with butter in a medium pot over medium-low heat until the onions are soft and transparent (3-5 minutes). Add the dry rice, turmeric, cumin, and cinnamon. Stir and cook these ingredients for about 3 minutes more to toast the dry rice and spices. You should hear it crackling a little as it cooks. Make sure to stir often so that the rice does not stick to the bottom of the pot."

      "text": "Add the chicken broth and bay leaf to the pot. Place a lid on top and turn the heat up to high. Let the pot come up to a full rolling boil and then turn the heat down to low. Let the pot simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, turn the heat off and let the pot sit for an additional 20 minutes without removing the lid or stirring the pot. After the final 20 minutes, fluff the rice with a fork."

      "text": "When the rice is close to being done, prepare the sauteed spinach. Mince a clove of garlic and add it to a very large pot along with the olive oil. Saute the garlic for 1-2 minutes over medium heat, or just until becomes soft and fragrant. Add the fresh spinach and saute for about 3 minutes, or just until the spinach has wilted. Season the spinach with salt and pepper to taste. Fry six eggs."

      "text": "To serve, add about one cup of warm rice to a bowl, add 1/2 cup of the sauteed spinach, and then top it off with a fried egg. Hot sauce adds a nice kick to this dish, too."
