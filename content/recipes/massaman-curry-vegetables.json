    "description": "Massaman Curry Veggies with homemade Massaman curry sauce. 1 Pot 30 Mins.\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2014/05/massaman-curry-vegetables-gluten-free.html\n\nFrom scratch Massaman curry sauce that has peanut butter, coconut milk, Thai Malay Spices and amazing flavor. 30 Minute vegan Massaman Curry. Vegan Gluten-free Soy-free Recipe. No Tofu.\n\nMassaman curry is a favorite in the house right after green and red curries. Massaman has a Malay influence on the curry and hence has spices.\nThe curry gets even more delicious the next day when the spices have had time to sit and infuse a more flavor. Add tofu or seitan or chickpeas to this curry for variations. \n\nThis Recipe is also in my Everyday Kitchen Cookbook. \nBUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \n\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n#vegan #veganism #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #veganricha #cooking \n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\nFOLLOW US:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nCOOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\n\nMY AMAZON STORE: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha\n✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧✦ ✧\n\nMusic: Life is\nBy Cosimo Fogg 201 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MXUHYGvBVY\nLife Is by Cosimo Fogg (201) https://soundcloud.com/cosimo-fogg\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 \nMusic promoted by Audio Library https://youtu.be/9MXUHYGvBVY",
