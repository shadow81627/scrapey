If you're around while the onions are cooking, stir them occasionally — this will help them cook more evenly, but isn't strictly necessary. After 10 hours, the onions will be golden-brown and soft, and they will have released a lot of liquid. If you like them as they are now, stop cooking and pack them up."

Leave the lid ajar so the liquid can evaporate. Check every hour and stop cooking whenever the onions look and taste good to you."

If any liquid remains in the slow cooker, transfer the liquid to a separate container — this can be used as cooking broth in another recipe. Onions will keep in the refrigerator for one week or in the freezer for at least 3 months."

    "description": "For a busy cook, caramelized onions pose a conundrum. We love the rich, deeply savory flavor they add to everything from creamy pastas to burgers, but caramelizing onions — truly caramelizing them — requires more time than many of us have for your average weeknight recipe. Luckily, I have a solution: Get out your slow cooker and make a huge batch (you can freeze most of it to have on hand for future meals!).",
