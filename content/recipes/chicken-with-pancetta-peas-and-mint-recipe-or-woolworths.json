    "200g pancetta, cubed, or bacon lardons",
    "2 cloves garlic, grated or finely chopped",

      "text": "Reduce the heat to low, and add the remaining oil and onions to the casserole. Sweat gently for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent, then add the pancetta or bacon. Increase the heat a little, and cook for a further 5 minutes until the pancetta or bacon is golden. Stir in the garlic, then pour in the wine. Increase the heat to high, and simmer for a few minutes until the alcohol has evaporated."

      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Add the stock, and bring to the boil once again. Season with salt and black pepper, tip in the peas, and stir through. Return the chicken pieces to the casserole. Stir through the parsley and mint, cover with a lid, and transfer to the oven to cook for 1 1 / 2 hours. Check the level of liquid occasionally while cooking - it needs to be fairly dry, but if it does need topping up, just add a little hot water. Serve hot with fresh crusty bread or sautéed potatoes."
