Add the coconut cream to a bowl with the powdered sugar (add to taste). Beat the coconut cream and powdered sugar together, whipping the coconut cream. You aren't so much whipping the coconut milk up, more like breaking it down. If it's too thick add in a splash of the leftover coconut water, or any non-dairy milk until you reach desired consistency."
