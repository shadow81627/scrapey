  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 cup un-toasted (raw) buckwheat flour",
    "3/4 Tbsp flaxseed meal",
    "1 3/4 cups light (canned) coconut milk (we found almond milk and lighter, less fatty milks to promote sticking to the pan)",
    "1 pinch sea salt",
    "1 Tbsp avocado or melted coconut oil (plus a bit more for cooking // or use nonstick pan)",
    "1/8th tsp ground cinnamon (optional // omit for savory)",
    "sweetener (optional // to taste // I used a dash of stevia // omit for savory or unsweetened)",
    "Compote",
    "Nut Butter",
    "Coconut Whipped Cream",

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Pulse in blender or whisk in mixing bowl to combine. The batter should be pourable but not watery. If too thin, add a bit more buckwheat flour. If too thick, thin with more dairy-free milk."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat a cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium heat. (Non-stick is typically best for crepes, but I used a seasoned cast-iron skillet and it worked well, too). Once hot, add a little oil and spread into an even layer. Let the oil heat until hot - when you flick a little water onto the pan, it should crackle and evaporate almost immediately."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add ~1/4 cup (60 ml) batter. Let cook until the top appears bubbly and the edges are dry (similar to pancakes). Then carefully flip and cook for 2-3 minutes more on the other side. Turn heat down if cooking too quickly."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Repeat until all crepes are prepared. We didn't find we needed to add any more oil after the first crepe. Keep warm between layers of parchment paper or on a plate under a towel."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Serve as is with a little vegan butter, nut butter, maple syrup, compote, or other fillings or choice! My preferred is vegan butter, berries, maple syrup, and banana. But these would also be delicious with coconut whipped cream, Cinnamon Baked Apples, fresh fruit (e.g. berries or bananas), or granola."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Best when fresh, but you can store leftovers sealed in the refrigerator up to 3 days. To freeze, layer between pieces of parchment paper (to prevent sticking) and freeze. Then store in a freezer-safe container up to 1 month. To reheat, warm in a 350-degree F (176C) oven or microwave until hot."
