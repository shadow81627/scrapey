Add in cumin and sauté one minute more. Add beans, water and red wine vinegar. Use a potato masher to mash about half of the beans and bring to a simmer. Lower heat and stir in spinach, adding a bit more water if the mixture seems too dry. Cook just until spinach wilts, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and fold in the cilantro."
