Add this to the remaining 1 cup of icing sugar along with 2 tablespoons of boiling water to mix together. Use the back of the spoon to combine to come together. At this stage you would add a few drops of pink or blue food colouring which I didn't end up doing however would do so the next time with the blueberry one as the blue colour didn't end up coming through once dried."
