Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook (be careful, it may bubble and splatter!), whisking constantly and reducing the heat if needed, until the mixture looks like a glossy, sticky cake batter with some small lumps, about 20 minutes. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed."

Sprinkle with kosher salt, flaky salt, or freshly ground black pepper. Enjoy with Sriracha mayo or harissa mayo, with a lemon wedge for squeezing, or your favorite dipping sauce."
