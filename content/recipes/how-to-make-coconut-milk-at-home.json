    "text": "Nut milk bags: You can find nut milk bags at many natural food stores or on Amazon.Storing and using homemade coconut milk: Store for up to 4 days in the refrigerator in an airtight container, or freeze for up to 3 months. Your coconut milk will separate after being refrigerated (or when thawed after being frozen) — this is normal! Just give it a good shake and it should be ready to use. Use homemade coconut milk as you would any other coconut milk."
