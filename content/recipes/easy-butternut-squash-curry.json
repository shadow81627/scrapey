    "1 tablespoon coconut oil",
    "1 medium onion (, sliced thinly)",
    "4 cloves garlic (, chopped finely)",
    "1 fresh chilli pepper (chopped finely, or 1/2 teaspoon of dried chilli flakes)",
    "3 tablespoons mild curry powder",
    "1 tablespoon arrowroot powder (, or cornstarch)",
    "1 medium butternut squash (, peeled, deseeded & chopped (see my post for how to tips)",
    "398 - 400ml / 13.5 oz canned coconut milk",
    "480mls / 2 cups vegetable stock or water",
    "3 large handfuls fresh spinach",
    "1 squeeze of lemon juice",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons salt (, add more to taste)",
