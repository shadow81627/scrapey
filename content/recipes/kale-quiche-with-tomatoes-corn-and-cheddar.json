      "text": "In the bowl of a food processor fitted with an s-blade combine the spelt flour, all purpose flour, salt, and cubed butter. Pulse the food processor several times, until the butter is roughly the size of grains of rice. With the food processor running add the ice water one tablespoon at a time. You want the pastry to be starting to pull together, but it should still be quite crumbly at this point. Stop the food processor and see whether it holds together if you squeeze it in your hand. If yes, you're done. If no, add one more tablespoon of water."
