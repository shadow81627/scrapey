You can also do this by cutting the butter or shortening into the flour using a pastry cutter or two forks, as you would when making a pie crust."

      "text": "Transfer the pressed tortilla to the hot skillet and cook each side for 30 seconds, or just until bubbles form and the bottom is lightly browned. Flip and cook for another 30 seconds. Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining dough balls. These can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 1 week, so definitely feel free to make them in advance. Just reheat them on a skillet before serving!"
