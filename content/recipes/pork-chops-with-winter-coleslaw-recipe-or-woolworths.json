Tip 1: You can prepare the dressing, hazelnuts and cabbage for the winter slaw the day before and toss with apple and dressing just before serving. This winter slaw makes a great salad for lunch as well. Tip 2: Mix whole egg mayonnaise with paprika and a squeeze of lemon for a quick sauce for your chops. Tip 3: Raw almonds, lightly toasted with skins on are a great substitute for hazelnuts in this winter slaw."
