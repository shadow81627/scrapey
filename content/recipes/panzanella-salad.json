  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 loaf of 2-day-old bread (tip: slicing the bread helps it dry out faster)",
    "5 oz salad greens (e.g. kale, baby spinach.)",
    "6 medium tomatoes",
    "1 cucumber",
    "10 fresh basil leaves",
    "2 cloves of garlic (minced)",
    "3 tablespoons olive oil",
    "3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar"

      "text": "While the bread is soaking, slice three of the tomatoes in half. With a cheese grater, grate each tomato half (open face against the grain) over a bowl to collect the pulp. Discard the peels. Add the garlic, olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and mix. Set aside."

      "text": "Return to the bread and test the texture. The bread should be soft and spongy. If it’s still dry, add more water. If it’s too wet, squeeze and drain excess water. Rip the bread into bite-sized pieces."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Mix the bread pieces with the dressing, drizzling additional olive oil and balsamic vinegar as needed. Once thoroughly mixed, let stand for at least an hour to allow the flavors to soak in. Salt and pepper to taste."
