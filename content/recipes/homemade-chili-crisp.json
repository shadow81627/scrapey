    "text": "Chilies: If you want to only use 1 type of dried chili pepper, go with erijingtiao chilies, which are more aromatic. Or substitute 3 ounces packaged Sichuanese chili flakes for the chilies. Just skip to Step 3 to combine the chili flakes with the sesame seeds, salt, and MSG, if using.Storage: The chili crisp can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a year."

(You can test the oil by adding a piece of ginger, which should bubble immediately, but gently.) Add the spices, ginger, scallions, and onion. Let the aromatics slowly fry and release their water content, infusing the oil. Keep an eye on the bubbling, which should always be gentle, and use a spatula to move things around to prevent burning, removing any burned bits immediately with a strainer. After 20 to 35 minutes, the onion and scallions should look shriveled and may be slightly toasted and the oil should be very fragrant. Scoop out and discard all the aromatics with a heatproof fine-mesh strainer."

They will sink, so use a spatula to move them around, making sure they don’t burn, and cook for 3 minutes. Ad1/2 cup skinless peanuts if using, and fry for 1 minute, moving everything constantly. The peanuts should not be rapidly browning — if they are, lower the heat."

Turn the heat off and continue to stir constantly down to the bottom of the pan for 2 to 3 minutes more. The crispy bits will finish toasting in the residual heat and the oil will turn red. Taste and season with more salt, powdered Sichuan peppercorn, MSG, or sugar as needed. Let cool completely, then spoon into jars."
