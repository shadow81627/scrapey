Bring to the boil, reduce heat and simmer for 21/2 hours. It is essential that can is kept covered with water during cooking. Remove pan from heat and allow can to cool in pan. When can is cool enough to handle, open and transfer caramel to a large bowl. Whisk vigorously until smooth."

      "text": "Alternate method for cooking caramel: Preheat oven to 220Â°C. Pour 395g can sweetened condensed milk to a baking dish. Place baking dish into a larger roasting pan and pour enough hot water into pan to come half way up the sides of baking dish. Completely cover pans tightly with aluminium foil. Bake for 1 hour 45 minutes, or until condensed milk turns a rich caramel. Check water level throughout cooking and top up if required. Transfer to an airtight container and store in the fridge. If caramel is too thick, add a little hot milk and whisk to desired consistency."
