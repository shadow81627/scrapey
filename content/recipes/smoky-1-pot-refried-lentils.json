      "text": "If cooking your lentils from scratch (not reflected in cook time), do so now by bringing twice the amount of water (or vegetable broth) as lentils to a boil. Then add lentils and bring back to a boil. Reduce heat to a simmer and cook uncovered until tender — depending on type of lentil and if they were soaked, anywhere from 7-20 minutes. Then drain and set aside. If using canned lentils, simply drain, rinse gently, and proceed with recipe."
