    "text": "Storage: The beans will keep for 1 week refrigerated or can be frozen for up to 3 months.Dry vs. canned amounts: One pound of dry beans makes about five cups of cooked beans, equivalent to about 3 cans of canned beans.Cooking beans for soup: If you intend to use your beans in a soup, it&#x27;s best to slightly undercook them here and then finish cooking them in the soup itself.The cooking liquid: Don&#x27;t pour it down the drain! Unlike the slimy liquid from canned beans, this cooking liquid is full of flavor and good nutrients. Once you&#x27;ve scooped up all your beans, this liquid makes a great base for soups and quick sauces."
