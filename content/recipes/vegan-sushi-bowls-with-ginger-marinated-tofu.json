    "1 cup dry sushi rice (or sub short-grain white or brown rice and increase water)",

    "1/2 cup tamari (or soy sauce if not gluten-free)",
    "3 Tbsp toasted sesame oil",
    "1/4 cup rice vinegar",

    "2 Tbsp maple syrup (optional)",
    "14 ounce package extra firm tofu, cut into 2 x 1/4-inch slices",
    "1/2 cup rice vinegar",
    "1/2 cup water",
    "1 Tbsp ginger, grated (a 1-inch piece yields ~1 Tbsp)",
    "1 cup thinly sliced carrots",
    "1 cup cucumber, cut into 3-inch matchsticks (1 large cucumber yields ~1 cup)",

Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until water is evaporated and rice is tender (~20 minutes). Turn off the heat and let rice steam with the lid on for 10 minutes."

      "text": "MARINATE TOFU: While the rice cooks, make the tofu marinade. In a medium bowl, whisk together the tamari, sesame oil, rice vinegar, grated ginger, and maple syrup (optional). Set aside 1/4 cup (60 ml) of the marinade for serving with finished bowls. Add the tofu to the remaining marinade and gently mix to combine and coat the tofu. Allow to marinate for at least 20 minutes, mixing every once in a while to ensure the tofu is marinating evenly."

      "text": "PICKLED CARROTS: Meanwhile, combine rice vinegar, water, ginger, and maple syrup (optional) in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer. This will be a brine to quick pickle your carrots. Place carrots into a medium-sized heat-proof bowl or jar and pour the simmering brine over the carrots. Cover and place in the refrigerator to cool while you proceed."
