Bring to the boil, reduce the heat to a low simmer, and cook for 2 minutes until it thickens. Cool completely. Pour the sauce over the chicken, and mix. Cover and chill for 1 hour, or up to 4 hours.

Thread the chicken onto the skewers and lay in a line along the tray, farthest away from the foil overlap. Fold the overlapping foil over the exposed handles, to prevent them burning."
