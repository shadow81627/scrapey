Toss them around with your fingers until they are all coated then tip them out onto the baking tray. Spread out into a single layer so there's a little space around each one. Sprinkle all over with a pinch or two of salt and bake for 12 minutes. Keep an eye on them in the last minute or two in case your oven runs hot and they get too dark.
