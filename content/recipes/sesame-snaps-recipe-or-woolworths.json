Once cooked, you only have seconds to finish the dish so it's important that all tools are ready and in place.I used a 42cm x 28cm silpat (no oil needed) but you can use a tray with or without baking paper. The surface (i.e tray or baking paper on tray) must be oiled to avoid the mixture sticking."

Using a preoiled spatula (I recommend an offset spatula), spread mixture out onto silpat/tray surface as fast as you can to achieve a nice thin layer.Speed is important because the caramel will being to harden within seconds. Note: There will be wastage. The mixture will stick to the pot and stirring spoons etc. Don't spend time trying to get every little bit out of the pot because you won't have time to spread the mixture out before it hardens."
