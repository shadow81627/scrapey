Sprinkle over the flour mixture and toss with your fingers to coat each piece with the flour mixture (this will prevent the butter from clumping together).

If any flattened bits are larger than a quarter, break them up, continuing to coat each butter piece with the flour mixture until large pebbles of butter form. Freeze for 5 minutes."

You want the biscuits to be as cold as possible when going in the oven, so work quickly. Sprinkle with demerara sugar, if using."
