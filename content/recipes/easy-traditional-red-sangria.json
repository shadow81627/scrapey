    "description": "Easy, traditional-style Spanish Red Sangria made with just 6 ingredients in 5 minutes! Perfectly crisp and not too sweet and super boozy!\n\nRecipe: http://minimalistbaker.com/easy-traditional-red-sangria/\n\nThe earliest versions of sangria believed to have originated more than 2,000 years ago when Romans, making their way through the Iberian Peninsula, planted vineyards along the way. And because drinking water was unsafe, it was often fortified with wine, spices, and herbs. The earliest versions of what we now know as sangria were made in England and France in the 1800s, and sangria was eventually popularized after its formal arrival in the U.S. at the 1964 Worldâ€™s Fair in New York.\n\nFollow us here:\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
