      "text": "Preheat oven to 200°C. Grease a large baking tray. Place pastry onto prepared tray. Fold 2cm of edge over, forming a border. Spread remaining parmesan over pastry. Top with onion, tomato and thyme. Bake for 25 minutes or until cooked through. Serve with pesto and basil. Tip 1: Store leftover pesto in a container in the fridge. Use within five days. Tip 2: Make a fresh, healthy start to the year by going meat free for at least one day of the week. Not only will you be adding a new veggie only recipe to your repertoire, but you’ll also be getting more nutritious veg into your diet."
