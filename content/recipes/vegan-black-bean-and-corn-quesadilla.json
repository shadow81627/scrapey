  "description": "Spiced black beans and corn, on top of a homemade melty dairy-free cheese, with diced tomato, green onions, and cilantro. This is the perfect easy weeknight meal, and bonus, most of it can be made ahead of time, making it quick to grab and assemble when hunger strikes.&nbsp;",

    "1/2 jalapeno (, finely diced (optional)",
    "1/2 cup black beans (, drained and rinsed)",
    "1/2 cup corn kernels (, thawed if frozen)",

      "text": "To assemble the quesadilla: Heat a large dry pan over medium heat. I like toasting my tortilla on both sides. To do that, lay the tortilla down in the pan and let toast for about 1 minute until it’s just starting to get golden spots on the bottom. Flip and now add the toppings to the toasted side of the tortilla. On one half, smear a couple spoonfuls of the nacho cheese across, then top with several spoonfuls of black bean and corn mixture, a sprinkle of diced tomatoes, and garnish with green onions, and cilantro. Use a spatula to fold over the tortilla making a half moon shape. Pat down the tortilla with your spatula so it all sticks together. Cook for about 2 minutes on one side, then flip and cook another 2 minutes on the other side so that the cheese is melted and everything is heated through. Remove from pan and cut into 4 triangles. Serve with salsa and vegan sour cream."
