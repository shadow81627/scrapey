Place the tofu slices into a small baking dish or zipper bag. In a small bowl, whisk together 2 tablespoons of sesame oil, tamari or soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and ginger. Pour the marinade over the tofu and turn tofu to help ensure the marinade has coated all sides. Place in refrigerator and marinate for 1-2 hours, turning occasionally."

Lay the tofu, pineapple, and zucchini on the grill and close the lid. Beware: the marinade on the tofu may cause it to flame up at first! Cook the pineapple and zucchini until they show golden-brown grill lines (about 5 minutes). Turn over and cook until lines appear on the other side (2-3 more minutes). Transfer to a large platter to cool. Flip the tofu when it starts to show grill lines (after 8-9 minutes). Cook on the other side until heated through and showing lines (3-4 more minutes). Transfer tofu to the platter. Let pineapple, zucchini, and tofu sit until they're cool to the touch and then cut them all into 1/2-inch size squares. Return to the platter and toss gently to combine."
