Turn the heat to medium-low and slowly add the non-dairy milk, stirring constantly. Stir for 5-10 minutes until the gravy begins to be noticeably thicker. It should clear the bottom of the skillet when stirred. Once they gravy has reached your desired thickness, remove from heat. Note: if your gravy is too thick, you can add an additional 1/4 to 1/2 cup of milk."
