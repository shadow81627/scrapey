    "1 tsp baking powder",
    "40g caster sugar",

    "2 large eggs, lightly beaten",
    "0.5 tsp vanilla extract",

Make a well in the centre of the flour mixture and whisk in the milk mixture, a little at a time, bringing in the flour as you go. Finally, whisk in the cooled, melted butter until the mixture is smooth."
