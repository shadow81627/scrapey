    "text": "Make ahead: The batter can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated in an airtight container. Let come to room temperature before cooking. (Otherwise they could come out dense!) Storage: The pikelets are best stored at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 2 to 3 days, or they can be frozen for up to 2 months. Rewarm in a skillet or toasted from frozen, using the frozen function on a toaster."
