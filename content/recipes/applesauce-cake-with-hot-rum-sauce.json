  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: The cake can be baked up to 1 day in advance. Cover tightly with plastic wrap and store at room temperature. Serve with the warm sauce. The sauce is best made just before serving. Storage: Leftover applesauce cake can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days, or wrapped in plastic wrap and stored in an airtight freezer-safe container for up to 3 months. Thaw the cake in the refrigerator overnight. The cake can be enjoyed cold, at room temperature, or warmed in the microwave. "
