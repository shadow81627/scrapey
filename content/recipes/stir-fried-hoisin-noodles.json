Stir-fry for about 1 minute, until the garlic is very fragrant and the chiles begin to darken. Add the broccoli, bell pepper, and carrots. Stir fry for about 2 minutes, just until the veggies begin to brighten in color and become tender-crisp. Add the noodles and the hoisin sauce mixture. continue to stir-fry for another minute or so, just until the sauce thickens up a bit and coats everything. Use a fork to separate the noodles and move them around the pan."
