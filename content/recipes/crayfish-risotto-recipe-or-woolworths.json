  "recipeIngredient": [
    "50g butter",
    "2 shallots, finely chopped",
    "1 mild red chili, thinly sliced",
    "1 tsp mild paprika",
    "1 clove garlic, crushed",
    "300g risotto rice",
    "0.67 cup dry white wine",
    "3 sprigs lemon thyme",
    "4.8 cups fish stock, hot",
    "3 tbs fresh tarragon, roughly chopped",
    "300g crayfish tails in brine, drained",
    "0.5 tsp salt",
    "2 tbs Parmesan cheese, freshly grated (to garnish)"

      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Add the thyme and a ladleful of the stock and cook, stirring, until the rice has almost absorbed the stock. Continue cooking, adding the stock a ladleful at a time, and letting the rice absorb most of the stock before adding more. Once the rice is tender but retaining a little bite, the risotto is ready-this will take about 25 minutes. You may not need all the stock."

      "text": "Stir in the tarragon, crayfish, and remaining butter and heat through gently for 1 minute. Add a little extra salt if necessary and serve immediately, garnished with Parmesan and with a watercress salad, if you like."
