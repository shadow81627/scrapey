I wanted to make a sweeter sauce which is why I let the onions and garlic caramelize a bit. If you donâ€™t like sweet sauces, proceed to the next step before they get any color on them."

Be careful of the splattering sauce! Leave a lid on the pot but slightly ajar to allow steam to escape but keep flying blobs of sauce from landing on your counter top."

      "text": "Taste the sauce after a half hour or so and adjust spices and seasoning to your liking. The proportions listed above yield a slightly sweet and tangy sauce. If you like savory sauces, leave out the balsamic vinegar and reduce the sugar to 1 tsp. Some sugar is usually needed to balance the high acidity of the tomatoes."
