    "Peanut or canola oil, for frying",
    "2 tablespoons butter",
    "3 cups cooked and shredded chicken (recipe below, or use store-bought rotisserie chicken)",
    "1 teaspoon paprika (regular or smoked)",
    "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1 teaspoon garlic powder",
    "3/4 teaspoon ground cumin",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground chipotle powder",
    "1/2 teaspoon chili powder",
    "1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper, or more to taste",
    "Freshly ground black pepper, to taste",
    "24 corn tortillas, 6 to 7 inches in diameter (a few might tear when rolling)",

In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken, paprika, kosher salt, garlic powder, cumin, chipotle, chili powder, cayenne, and a few generous grinds of black pepper. Add the chicken to the skillet and cook until warmed through. Adjust any seasonings to personal taste (note: you want the flavors to be bold in the chicken mixture—i.e. spicy, smoky, salty— because they won't be as strong once you add the cheese and tortilla.)"

Place two tablespoons of chicken mixture into the middle of the tortillas and sprinkle with crumbled queso fresco. Tightly roll each tortilla and secure with a toothpick(s). Using long tongs, carefully add each tortilla to the oil, gently clamping closed for a moment to help the shell set. Adjust the heat as necessary to maintain the temperature while frying. Cook the tortillas until very crisp and light golden in color, about 1-2 minutes. Shake off the excess oil back into the pot before placing the flauta on a paper-towel lined sheet pan."

Add enough cooking liquid (I used a mix of chicken stock and beer) to completely cover the chicken and sprinkle in a few teaspoons of kosher salt. Bring the liquid to a gentle boil over medium-high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low (try to maintain the temperature of cooking liquid to between 170°F and 180°F) and simmer until the chicken reaches the internal temperature of 160°F, about 15 minutes."

      "text": "Place hot/warm chicken in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with beater attachment. Turn the mixer on low, then increase power to medium (watch out for splashing!) and mix until chicken is shredded to desired texture, about 30 seconds. (If you don't have a stand mixer, just shred the chicken using the two fork method, or my favorite, the \"bear claw.\") Return chicken to the poaching liquid to cool. Strain before using. Yields approximately 3 cups shredded chicken. (I made the chicken the night before so the flauta recipe came together in a flash.)"
