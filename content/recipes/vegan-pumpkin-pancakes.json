Once hot add about 1/3 cup or a ladle full of the batter at a time to the hot pan/griddle. Spread it a little to tidy it up if you need to but leave it quite thick (a little under 1/2 inch is ideal). Turn the heat to medium low and leave the pancakes to cook undisturbed until bubbles start to appear all over the top."
