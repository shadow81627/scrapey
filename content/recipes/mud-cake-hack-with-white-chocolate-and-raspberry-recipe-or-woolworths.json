    "3 Woolworths white mud cakes",
    "500g Woolworths frozen raspberry",
    "250g unsalted butter",

      "text": "Combine 3 cups of frozen raspberries, water and icing in a food processor or blender and blitz until a smooth paste is formed. Add water a little bit at a time as you do not want the mixture to be too runny. Mayonnaise consistency is what you are trying to achieve."

      "text": "Place one cake layer on a plate. Add a layer of the raspberry filling and then place another cake layer on top. Repeat until all cake is used leaving the top layer plain. Place 5 wooden kebab skewers in the cake for stability, then wrap and place in the freezer for 2 hours, or over night if possible. Freezing the cake stops the crumbs from coming off when it is time to ice the cake."
