    "description": "Wheat Naan Bread. Soft, Amazing 100% Whole Grain Naan flatbread. Oilfree option\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2018/07/wheat-naan-bread-vegan-indian-naan-recipe.html\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Cookbooks: https://veganricha.com/mybooks\n\nWhole grain flours behave differently, absorb a lot more liquid and need some tricks to ensure that the breads are soft â€“ not dry, airy & not dense and generally pleasing to taste. This wheat Naan recipe is slightly different from a regular Naan. It uses a sponge (a mix of some flour and wet ingredients that sit to hydrate for 25 mins). This extra hydration allows the bread dough to hold more moisture.\n\nThe rest of the process is just like my regular Naan. Add toppings of choice such as garlic, herbs, nigella seeds etc. Serve with Curries such as  Butter Tofu(so good!), Mushroom Masala, Achari Sauce tofu/veggies, Pasanda, Instant Pot Butter Chiken etc , or make Naan pizza! Soyfree Nutfree Recipe. Oilfree Option\nDo read the Tip Section on the post to get the best result. \nGluten-free, Grainfree Naan options are available in my Indian Kitchen book: https://veganricha.com/vrikamzn\n\n\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ BUY MY COOKBOOK: http://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen \nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ Join the Mailing List: https://veganricha.com/mailinglist\nðŸ’™ðŸ§¡ SUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\nâœ¦ JOIN THE COMMUNITY:\nMy blog: http://veganricha.com\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nâœ¦ COOKBOOKS:\nVegan Richa's Indian kitchen: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nVegan Richa's Everyday Kitchen Book:\nhttp://www.veganricha.com/vrekaz\nMy Amazon Store: https://www.amazon.com/shop/veganricha \nâœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§âœ¦ âœ§\n\n#vegan #veganism #veganricha #easyveganrecipes #veganrecipes #cooking \nMusic: Erykah by Otis Mcdonald",
