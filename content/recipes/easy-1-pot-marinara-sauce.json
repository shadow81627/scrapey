    "2 Tbsp olive oil (sub water if avoiding oil)",
    "2 large cloves garlic (minced)",
    "2 28-ounce cans peeled crushed or diced tomatoes without salt",
    "1 tsp dried or fresh oregano",
    "1 Tbsp coconut sugar (or sub stevia or maple syrup to taste // omit if avoiding sugar)",
    "3/4 - 1 tsp sea salt",
    "1/4 tsp red pepper flake (reduce or increase according to spice preference)",
    "1/2 cup roughly chopped fresh basil (plus more for serving)",
