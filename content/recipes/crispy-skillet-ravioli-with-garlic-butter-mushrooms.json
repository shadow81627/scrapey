Skip that usual step and instead, pan-fry your ravioli in a hot skillet with an abundance of tender, caramelized mushrooms made rich with garlic butter and a splash of balsamic. Top it all off with lots of grated Pecorino or Parmesan cheese, for good measure, then toss the skillet under the broiler for a few minutes to ensure a melty, browned and crisp top.\n\nSee full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/crispy-skillet-ravioli-with-garlic-butter-mushrooms-23136152)",
