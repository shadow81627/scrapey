    "12 oz. green beans, ends trimmed (12 oz. yields ~4-5 cups trimmed)",
    "1/4 cup vegetable broth (or store-bought)",
    "2 Tbsp tamari or low-sodium soy sauce (ensure gluten-free as needed)",
    "1 Tbsp minced fresh ginger",
    "1 Tbsp minced garlic (2 large cloves yield ~1 Tbsp or 9 g)",
    "1/2 tsp red pepper flakes",
    "1 pinch sea salt",
    "1/2 tsp maple syrup",
    "1 Tbsp avocado oil (or other neutral, high-heat oil)",

Reduce the heat to medium-high, then quickly add the sauce mixture (it will be steamy). Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3-5 minutes, until the beans are tender with a little crunch (al dente) and the liquid is reduced. Turn off the heat and stir in the sesame seeds (optional)."
