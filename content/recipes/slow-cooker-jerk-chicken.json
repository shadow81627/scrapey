    "5 lbs chicken pieces ($6.18)",
    "1/4 cup molasses (not black strap) ($0.55)",

    "1/3 cup soy sauce ($0.11)",
    "4 cloves garlic, peeled ($0.32)",
    "3-4 inches fresh ginger ($0.28)",

    "1/4 tsp nutmeg ($0.03)",

Nestle the pieces down in and under the chicken so that they make close contact. Place the lid on the slow cooker, turn it on to high, and let it cook undisturbed for four hours."

      "text": "After four hours, carefully remove the chicken and place it on a broiler pan or a baking sheet covered with foil. Tongs work best for this as the chicken will be very hot and very delicate. Spread the rest of the spice rub carefully over the surface of the chicken. Adjust the rack in your oven so that the top of the chicken is 4-5 inches below the broiler. Broil on high for about 5 minutes or until the skin is crispy and browned. Watch the chicken closely as all broilers are different. Broilers can quickly burn food because of their high heat and close proximity of the heat source."
