Drain and rinse with cold water. Alternatively, you can soak the cashews, by placing the cashews in a bowl, covering them with water, and allowing the cashews to soak for a minimum of 6 hours or overnight. Drain and rinse before using.Both of these methods will soften the cashews making them easier to blend into a creamy texture."

Easy vegan blue cheese will keep for 1 – 2 weeks in the fridge or can be frozen. Serve vegan blue cheese with crackers or bread, spread on a sandwich, add to a salad, or use it anywhere you like! This would be a beautiful addition to a vegan snack board."
