    "1 1/2 cups rolled oats (gluten-free for GF eaters)",
    "3/4 cup slivered almonds (or chopped raw almonds)",
    "2/3 cup packed pitted dates, measured after pitting",
    "1/3 cup packed dried tart cherries (unsweetened if possible, or sub other tart dried fruit // plus more for topping)",
    "1/4 cup seeds of choice (we love flax, hemp, sesame, and chia)",
    "1/4 cup maple syrup (or honey if not vegan)",
    "1/4 cup creamy salted natural almond butter (just almonds + salt)",
    "1 Tbsp coconut oil",
    "1 healthy pinch sea salt",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract (optional)"

Use a spoon or your hands to mix thoroughly. It should be very tacky and hold its shape when squeezed between two fingers. If too dry or crumbly, add a bit more maple syrup and/or almond butter and continue mixing."

Cover with parchment and press down with something flat, such as a drinking glass, to get the mixture packed really tightly. This will prevent the bars from being crumbly. Chill in the freezer for 15-20 minutes to harden."

Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks, or in the freezer for up to 2 months. They travel fine if taking on-the-go, though they keep their shape best right out of the freezer or refrigerator."
