    "1 cup quinoa (I used a combo of red and white quinoa, rinsed very well)",
    "2 cups vegetable broth",
    "2 cloves garlic (minced)",
    "1/4 cup freshly squeezed lemon or lime juice",
    "3 tablespoons vegetable broth",
    "1 teaspoon chia seeds or ground flaxseed",
    "1 teaspoon ancho chile powder (or other pure chile powder, not a blend)",
    "1/2 teaspoon cumin",
    "1/4 teaspoon chipotle chile powder (or to taste)",
    "1/2 tsp salt (optional, or to taste)",
    "4-6 cups chopped kale leaves (about 4-5 ounces)",
    "1 15-ounce can black beans (about 1 1/2 cups, rinsed and drained)",
    "1/2 cup grated carrot",
    "1/2 red bell pepper (chopped)",

Two minutes of massaging should do it, but the longer, the better. Add the quinoa, black beans, carrot, and bell pepper, along with the remaining dressing. Mix well and refrigerate until ready to serve."
