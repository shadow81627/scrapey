  "description": "This moist, fat-free vegan cornbread is spiked with peppers and whole kernels of corn. Make it spicy with bits of jalapeño pepper. You can turn this into plain old cornbread by leaving out the peppers and corn...but why?",

    "2 teaspoon baking powder",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "1 cup low-fat plain soymilk (soymilk works best, but other non-dairy milks will do)",
    "1/4 cup water",
    "1/2 cup plain soy yogurt (Soy yogurt is best but unsweetened apple sauce works ok)",
    "1/2 green bell pepper (diced)",
    "1/2 red bell pepper (diced)",
