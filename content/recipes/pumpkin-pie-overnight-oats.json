You should be able to smell the pecans slightly when they’ve gotten toasty! Turn the heat down to low, add the maple syrup, and mix quickly to evenly coat the pecans. Spread them out so they are not in any large clumps, then add the pumpkin pie spice and mix once more. Remove from heat and let cool completely. Store in an airtight container."
