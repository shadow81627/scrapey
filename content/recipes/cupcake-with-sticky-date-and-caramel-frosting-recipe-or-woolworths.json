Dollop onto the centre of each cooled cupcake. Garnish with nuts, if using. Tip 1: Replace the dried dates with 1 cup chopped fresh dates when they are in season. Tip 2: Cupcakes will keep for 5 days in an airtight container lined with foil at room temperature. Tip 3: To serve as a dessert replace the frosting with warmed salted caramel sauce. Drizzle over the warm cakes and serve a dollop of thick cream."
