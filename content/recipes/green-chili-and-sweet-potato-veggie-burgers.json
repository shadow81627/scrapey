Place the diced sweet potatoes on a baking sheet and drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Roast sweet potatoes until starting to brown on the outside and tender on the inside, about 25-30 minutes. Burgers work best if you let rice and sweet potatoes cool for about 30 minutes."
