    "1/2 teaspoon dried dill (or 1 teaspoon fresh dill)",
    "1/4 teaspoon black pepper",

Add the jackfruit to a large bowl and use a potato masher to mash the jackfruit until it is broken up and looks shredded. Sometimes jackfruit can be quite tender while sometimes it can be tougher, so if you have a tougher jackfruit it might take a bit of strength mash. If you prefer you can first chop the jackfruit as directed in this post before mashing it to make it a bit easier to mash."
