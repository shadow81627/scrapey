  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Storage: Refrigerate the bars for up to 1 week. Using raw seeds: If you start with raw, unsalted pumpkin and sunflower seeds, roast at 350Â°F until lightly golden, about 10 minutes first. If you would prefer not to buy both, you can make these with all pumpkin or all sunflower seeds. Add 1/4 teaspoon more flaky salt to the bars.Using nut butters: Creamy, sugar-free nut butters can be substituted for sunflower seed butter. Vegan granola bars: To make these vegan, use maple syrup instead of honey."
