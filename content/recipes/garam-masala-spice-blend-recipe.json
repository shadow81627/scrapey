    "description": "CURRY POWDER and GARAM MASALA\n\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/curry-powder-recipe/\nhttps://www.veganricha.com/homemade-garam-masala-spice-blend-recipe/\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n\nEasy Homemade Curry Powder Recipe and quick small batch Garam Masala. Ready in 2 mins. Adjust the ingredients to make your favorite spice blends. Use the seasoning in curries, dals, Indian food, roasted veggies, bowls, add to beans, hummus. \n\nCurry Powders vary by brands and ethnic influences (Caribbean, Japanese, Srilankan, British) and can be very Varied in terms of flavors and ingredients. The British/western Curry powder which is used for indianish curries, is not really used in authentic Indian food. It is often a blend of spices mixing some northern Indian and southern Indian spices.\n\nThere is no one blend used in all of Indian cuisine. Depending on the region, the blends vary in names and spices. Garam masala, Goda masala, Sambhar Powder, Kashmiri Garam masala etc. The dry masala(blend)s which can be thought of as  regional curry powders are used to make specific curries. The Indian market also has picked up on the popularity of this naming as well and you will find “curry powders” such as Madras Curry powder, Kashmiri Curry powder, vindaloo curry powder etc which as basically versions of kashmiri garam masala, vindaloo masala etc. \n\nThis is my version of the generic curry powder for Indian curries. I build up the recipe with the garam masala for more Indian flavor profile. You can adjust the flavor based on your preference with additional cinnamon, turmeric or heat.\n\n******MORE SPICE BLENDS FROM THE BLOG******\n\nCAJUN SPICE RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/cajun-spice-recipe/\n\nGINGERBREAD SPICE MIX: https://www.veganricha.com/gingerbread-spice-mix-recipe/\n\nPUMPKIN PIE SPICE: https://www.veganricha.com/recipe-pages/pumpkin-pie-spice-recipe/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n\n#veganricha #easyveganreecipes #currypowder #garammasala #glutenfree",
