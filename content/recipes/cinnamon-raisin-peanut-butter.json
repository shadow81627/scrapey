    "3 cups roasted unsalted peanuts",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt, plus more to taste (if peanuts are salted, omit additional salt)",
    "2 Tbsp cassia cinnamon* (yes, Tablespoons!)",
    "1/4 tsp powdered stevia (or 1 Tbsp (3 g) powdered cane or coconut sugar, or 1 Tbsp (15 ml) maple syrup)*)",
    "1 Tbsp avocado oil (optional)",

      "text": "Add sea salt, cinnamon, and sweetener of choice. If using maple syrup, start with 1 Tbsp (15 ml). Adding more than that amount may cause the mixture to seize (liquid and fat don't mix well), which is why we recommend a little stevia and a little maple syrup."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add raisins and pulse a couple of times until combined. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more cinnamon for intense cinnamon flavor, sweetener for sweetness, or salt for saltiness."
