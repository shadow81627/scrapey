      "text": "Cut each pastry sheet into four squares. Fold each square loosely into a triangle. Starting from the folded side, cut a 1cm border, stopping 1cm before connecting at the pointy end. Place thumbs on the two points of your squares where the pastry centre is still attached to the border. Twist these corners once. The border will now overlap the centre square. Place on tray and brush edges with beaten egg."
