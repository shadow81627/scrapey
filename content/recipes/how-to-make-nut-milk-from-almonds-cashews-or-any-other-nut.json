Cover the bowl with a cloth and let sit overnight at room temperature or for up to 2 days in the refrigerator. The nuts will plump as they absorb water and should feel a little squishy if you pinch them. The longer the nuts soak, the creamier the milk will be."

    "description": "Nut milks are nothing new. In fact, Emma gave us the play-by-play on making our own almond milk at home a few years ago here. But as the variety of nut milks, nut milk blends, and hybrid almond-coconut-hemp milk creamers continue to fill the shelves, we wondered if we could make every kind of nut milk at home. The answer is a resounding \"Oh heck yes!\" because not only can you make any nut milk at home, but it also tastes better, has fewer ingredients, and can be customized at least a hundred different ways. Today we will go through the process of making any nut milk at home using cashews for a creamy, dreamy non-dairy milk. Once you've mastered the steps, you can make any and every kind of nut milk at home.",
