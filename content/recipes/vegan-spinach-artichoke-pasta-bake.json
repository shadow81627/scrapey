    "description": "VEGAN SPINACH ARTICHOKE PASTA BAKE\n\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-spinach-artichoke-pasta-bake-recipe/\n\nSUBSCRIBE HERE: https://www.youtube.com/veganricharecipes?sub_confirmation=1\n\nYou will love this delicious creamy Vegan Spinach and Artichoke Pasta Bake recipe. It’s like having spinach and artichoke dip, but for dinner! Dairy-free, plant-based & so easy to make. I use tofu for the creamy base in this one. To make it without soy, just use my nut based spinach artichoke dip.\n\nIt’s fresh yet oh so creamy, fancy yet very easy to make any day of the week, and as tasty as can be. It’s basically the same concept as a restaurant-style spinach & artichoke dip but served as a pasta bake. I use tofu for the creamy base in this one. To make it without soy, just use my nut based spinach artichoke dip. Thin it a bit with non dairy milk, mix in the pasta and done.\n\n******MORE PASTA RECIPES FROM THE BLOG******\n\nFETTUCCINE ALFREDO WITH MUSHROOMS: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-fettuccine-alfredo-with-mushrooms-nut-free/\n\nGARLIC PASTA WITH ROASTED CAJUN CAULIFLOWER: https://www.veganricha.com/vegan-garlic-pasta-roasted-cajun-cauliflower/\n\nCREAMY ROASTED RED PEPPER PASTA WITH BLACK PEPPER CHICKPEAS: https://www.veganricha.com/creamy-roasted-red-pepper-pasta-black-pepper-chickpeas/\n\nCOOKBOOKS BY RICHA HINGLE (VEGAN RICHA): https://www.veganricha.com/mybooks/\n\nConnect with me on Social Media:\n\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\n\nINSTAGRAM: https://instagram.com/veganricha\n\nPINTEREST: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/\n\nTWITTER: https://twitter.com/veganricha\n\n\nMusic: Epidemic Sound \n#veganricha #easyveganreecipes #pasta #spinachartichoke",
