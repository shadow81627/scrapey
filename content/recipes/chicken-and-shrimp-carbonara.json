    "1 pound dried bucatini pasta",
    "1 tablespoon olive oil",
    "1 boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 8 ounces)",
    "3/4 teaspoon kosher salt, divided, plus more as needed",
    "1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper, divided, plus more for serving",
    "1 medium red bell pepper",
    "2 cloves garlic",
    "1 ounce Parmesan cheese (1/2 cup firmly packed freshly grated or 1/3 cup store-bought grated), plus more for serving",
    "1 ounce Pecorino Romano cheese (1/2 cup firmly packed freshly grated or 1/3 cup store-bought grated), plus more for serving",
    "12 uncooked medium shrimp, peeled and deveined (6 to 8 ounces)",
    "4 slices bacon (about 4 ounces), cold from the refrigerator",

Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch high-sided skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the chicken and cook until it is well-browned and it releases easily from the pan, 5 to 7 minutes. Flip and reduce the heat to medium. Continue cooking until the chicken is cooked through, 5 to 7 minutes more. Transfer to a clean cutting board. Reserve the skillet."

Meanwhile, cut 1 medium red bell pepper into 1/4-inch thick slices and mince 2 garlic cloves. Finely grate 1 ounce Parmesan cheese and 1 ounce Pecorino Romano cheese if needed (about 1/2 packed cup each), or measure out 1/3 cup of each.

Add 1 1/4 cups heavy cream and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the heat to medium-low and gently simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce is slightly thickened, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the shrimp in the last 1 minute of simmering time. Reduce the heat to low to keep warm if the pasta is not ready yet. Cut the chicken breast crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces."

Add the chicken, bacon, and 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water, and toss to combine. Add the cheeses and remaining 3/4 teaspoon black pepper. Continue tossing the pasta with tongs to evenly distribute and coat with sauce, 1 to 2 minutes total. Add more pasta water 1 to 2 tablespoons at a time as needed until the pasta is lightly coated with a slightly thin sauce (it will thicken as it cools). Taste and season with more kosher salt and black pepper as needed. Serve immediately, garnishing with more black pepper and grated cheese as desired."
