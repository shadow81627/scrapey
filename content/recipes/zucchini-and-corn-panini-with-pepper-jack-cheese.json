Put half of the cheese on 4 slices of bread, then top that with the veggie mixture, remaining cheese, and remaining slices of bread. Butter the tops of the sandwiches with half of the butter. Carefully place the sandwiches on the panini press, buttered side down, then butter the other side of the sandwiches and close the press. (Depending on the size of the bread and your panini press, you may have to do 2 sandwiches at a time.) Cook for 5-7 minutes or until cheese has melted and bread is toasted."
