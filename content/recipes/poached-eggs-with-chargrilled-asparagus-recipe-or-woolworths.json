      "text": "When the asparagus is nearly ready, bring a large pan of salted water to the boil. Crack an egg into a tea cup and gently slide into the bubbling water. Repeat for all the eggs (using a tea cup helps them maintain their shape). Poach the eggs in very gently simmering water for about 3 minutes until the white is set but the yolk is still runny. (The trick to perfect poached eggs is that they must be very fresh; this helps the white to stay together in a neat shape.)"
