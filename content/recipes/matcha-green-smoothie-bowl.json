    "2 peeled, sliced and frozen ripe bananas (~120 g each)",
    "1/4 cup chopped ripe pineapple (optional // frozen is best)",
    "3/4 - 1 cup light coconut milk (canned or carton)*)",
    "2 tsp matcha green tea powder (see our Matcha Review!)",
    "1 heaping cup organic spinach or kale (I like to freeze mine to make the smoothie colder!)",

      "text": "Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more banana (or a touch of maple syrup or stevia) for sweetness, matcha for more intense green tea flavor, or coconut milk for creaminess (though adding more matcha powder adds more caffeine, so use your best discretion). Pineapple will add a little tart/tang, so add more if desired."

      "text": "Divide between two serving bowls (amount as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size) and top with desired toppings (optional). I went with fresh raspberries, chia seeds, and coconut flake. Bananas would make a delicious garnish as well."
