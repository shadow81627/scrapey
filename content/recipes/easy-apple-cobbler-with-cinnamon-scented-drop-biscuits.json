    "description": "What draws me to a cobbler is that for minimal work you can have a hearty apple dessert that feels like you took all the time in the world.\nWhy cobblers instead of pie on Thanksgiving? Cobblers are an easy way to contribute to your Thanksgiving spread without the labor of a full pie. I love apple pie as much as the next person, but when I’m busting out a 13-course meal, cutting this little corner is a great way to save myself time and effort and not miss out any of those pie feels. Also, if you are a beginner baker, cobblers are a great way to introduce yourself to apple desserts!",
