    "text": "Baking pie dough: Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and heat to 400°F. Roll out pie dough and transfer to a 9-inch standard pie pan. Press the dough into the bottom and along the sides of the pie plate, being careful not to puncture the dough. Crimp or press decorations into the edge of the crust and trim any excess dough away with a paring knife.Line the dough with parchment paper and fill with pie weights, dry beans, or granulated sugar for blind baking. Place the pie crust on a baking sheet and bake until golden-brown, about 20 minutes. Using the parchment paper as a sling, remove the pie weights. Return the crust to the oven and bake for 5 minutes to crisp the bottom of the crust. Set the pie crust aside to cool while you prepare the filling. Make ahead: The pie can be prepared up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated. Loosely cover the pie in plastic wrap after the filling firms up.Storage: Leftover pie can be lightly covered with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 3 days."
