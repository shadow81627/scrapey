    "description": "Homemade Vegan Margherita Pizza Recipe. 20 Minute Pizza crust, 5 minute Pizza sauce and a creamy cashew mozzarella cheese sauce. All from scratch!\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/09/vegan-margherita-pizza-recipe.html\n\nVegan Soy-free Recipe. Gluten-free and nut-free options.\n\nSometimes you just want a ridiculously good pizza and the pizza restaurants are too far away, have shut down, or offer sub par vegan experience. Then you just go to the kitchen and whip up a super fresh delicious margherita pizza with gooey cashew cheese, all made from scratch.\n\nYou can speed up the process by either making the components ahead of time or using store bought options. With a store bought pizza sauce, this pizza comes together in 20-30 mins and then you have to wait and fight over the fresh slices. The recipe is easily doubled!\n\nThe pizza dough (its my easy 20 minute pizza dough) doesnâ€™t need much kneading. Just bring the dough together and let it rise for 15 mins, then shape it using some flour. This dough is shaped easily as it does not have much gluten development (which develops with longer kneading) and hence is not the stretchy traditional pizza dough, so no struggling to roll it out!\n\nThe cashew mozzarella cheese sauce is a few ingredients. Just blend, and simmer to thicken, and use. No chill time to let it set. The final result we want is a cheesy melty topping, So keep the state as thick saucy to begin with! problem solved.\n\nLets make this!\n\n#easyveganrecipes #veganricha #margheritapizza #veganmargherita #veganmozzarella\n\nMY BOOKS:\nINDIAN KITCHEN:  https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-indian-kitchen-cookbook\nEVERYDAY KITCHEN: https://veganricha.com/vegan-richas-everyday-kitchen\nBoth have about 150 Recipes each.
