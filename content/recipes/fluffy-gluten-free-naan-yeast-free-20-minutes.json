    "1/4 cup plain coconut yogurt (Culina is our favorite)",
    "1/2 cup light coconut milk (canned), plus more as needed",
    "1 tsp olive oil (if oil-free, omit and add more coconut milk as needed)",
    "2 tsp baking powder",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "2 small cloves garlic",
    "1/2 cup coconut flour (we haven’t tested almond flour, but it might work)",
    "1/2 cup arrowroot starch (we haven’t tested other starches, but cornstarch might work)",
    "1/2 cup potato starch (NOT flour // potato starch is pretty key here for fluffy texture, so I’d be hesitant to sub it out)",
    "1/4 cup gluten-free all-purpose flour",
    "Olive oil or melted vegan butter",
    "Crushed garlic",
    "Fresh parsley, minced"

      "text": "Next add coconut flour, arrowroot starch, and potato starch and stir with a wooden spoon to combine. It should form a dough that is moist and malleable, doesn’t stick to your hands, and also doesn’t crack easily when rolled. Add more potato starch as needed if too sticky. Add more light coconut milk as needed if it’s too dry."

Flip carefully and cook for another 2-3 minutes (less if you prefer a more pillowy naan). Lower heat as needed to ensure it doesn’t burn. You’ll know it’s done when both sides are golden brown."

      "text": "Drizzle with a little olive oil and garnish with more minced garlic and/or some fresh parsley if desired (all optional). Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days, though best when fresh. To freeze, place cooked, cooled naan in a freezer-safe container or bag (adding parchment paper between each naan will prevent sticking) and freeze for up to 1 month. To serve, either heat from frozen in a toaster oven, thaw overnight and then heat in a skillet, or microwave from frozen until warm. As with most bread, best when fresh."

Perfect for pairing with curries, dips, and more. And it’s freezer friendly!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/fluffy-gluten-free-naan-yeast-free-20-minutes/\n\nNaan is believed to date as far back as 1300 AD when it was mentioned in the notes of an Indo-Persian poet. Then, around 1526, it became popular among royals of the Mughal era in India. Because naan contained yeast (which was very expensive), it was reserved for royalty. Once yeast became more readily available, naan’s popularity spread throughout India and to other parts of the world.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
