    "text": "Chipotle chile powder is different from ordinary chili powder-- it&#x27;s ground dried smoked jalapeños and has a distinctive hot, smoky, sweet flavor.When I have a little extra time before a party, I&#x27;ll whip up a batch of these really delicious nuts. They&#x27;re sweet, salty, and spicy--with lots of brown sugar, maple syrup, chipotle powder, and fresh rosemary. Roasting is the process that brings out the most flavor in nuts, and serving them warm is a particularly nice touch. - Ina GartenReprinted with permission from Barefoot Contessa How Easy is That? by Ina Garten, copyright (c) 2010, Clarkson Potter."
