Add the onion, garlic and capsicum, then cook, stirring often, for 56 minutes or until the vegetables have softened. Add the tomato paste and cook for 1 minute, then add the stock and vinegar. Bring to simmering point, then cover and cook for 15 minutes over low-medium heat or until the vegetables are very tender. Add the basil (if using) and stir through just to wilt."

      "text": "Meanwhile, place each eggplant directly over a medium gas flame on your stovetop and cook, turning often, for 10 minutes or until the skin is blackened and the eggplant is very soft (alternatively, bake the eggplants in a preheated 200°C oven for 20 minutes or until soft). When the eggplants are cool enough to handle, peel them, taking care to get rid of as much charred skin as possible, then combine the flesh with the garlic and parsley in a bowl. Use a fork to mash to a coarse purée, then season to taste with salt and pepper."
