    "text": "Canned sweet potatoes variation: Use 2 (29-ounce) cans sweet potatoes in light syrup. Drain the sweet potatoes but don’t rinse — we want some but not all of the syrup. Microwave the sweet potatoes in a large bowl on HIGH for 4 minutes, stirring halfway through, then continue with the recipe beginning at step 4, using 1/3 cup packed light brown sugar, 3 tablespoons unsalted butter,  1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, and 3/4 teapsoon kosher salt. Keep the same amount of marshmallows for topping.Make ahead: The casserole can be prepared without the marshmallows, covered, and refrigerated for up to 3 days. Let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes before topping with the marshmallows and baking.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 5 days."

    "description": "Sweet potato casserole is one of the most popular Thanksgiving side dishes for a reason: It serves up the vegetable in a creamy, sweet, and decadent way, and as we pile it onto our plates, it makes us feel like a kid again. Unfortunately, it's often overthought and over-complicated, riddled with too many unnecessary steps and ingredients (I'm guilty of it, too, although this version is delish). This year, we're presenting you with the absolute easiest five-ingredient sweet potato casserole. In less than an hour (and with barely any dishes to wash), you'll be rewarded with buttery mashed sweet potatoes piled under a layer of creamy, tender-crisp marshmallows.\n\nGet the full recipe: https://www.thekitchn.com/sweet-potato-casserole-recipe-263094",
