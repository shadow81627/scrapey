Anything ovenproof will do, such as a ceramic dish, skillet, 7 or 8-inch cake pan or an 8 x 8 cake pan. (can also be made in a muffin pan - see recipe notes)If you want to be able to turn the baked oatmeal out like I did in the photos use a 7 or 8-inch loose bottom cake pan with a circle of parchment paper in the bottom."
