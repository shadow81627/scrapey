  "recipeIngredient": [
    "7 oz. dried spaghetti (I used whole wheat)",
    "3 tbsp. olive oil (plus more for drizzling)",
    "2 medium zucchini (thinly sliced lengthwise)",
    "3 cloves garlic (finely chopped)",
    "1 1/2 tsp. fresh sage (chopped)",
    "1 1/2 tsp. fresh rosemary (chopped)",
    "2 tbsp. grated Parmesan or Pecorino Romano cheese (plus more for serving (optional)",
    "4 oz. feta cheese (crumbled (optional)",
    "zest of 1/2 lemon",
    "sea salt and black pepper (to taste)"

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "First cook the spaghetti (check the package for specific instructions) by bringing a large saucepan of water to a boil, adding a couple of large pinches of sea salt and then the spaghetti; it should take about 8-10 minutes to cook. Stir every so often so the strands of pasta don't stick together. When the pasta is just cooked (al dente), drain it in a colander, drizzle with a little olive oil and then mix to lightly coat the pasta and prevent the strands from sticking together. Set it aside."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "You can use the same saucepan to make the sauce. Pour in the 3 tablespoons of olive oil and heat over medium heat, then add the zucchini and sauté for 4-5 minutes, before adding the garlic and herbs and mixing well. Sauté for a couple more minutes, to allow all the flavors to come together and the zucchini to cook through."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Return the cooked spaghetti to the pan and heat through, then mix in the cheese and lemon zest, and season with a little sea salt (you may not need much since the feta cheese is salty) and a good grind of black pepper. Serve, with a little more grated cheese sprinkled over, if you wish."
