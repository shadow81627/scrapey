If you're already doing this, you know exactly what I'm talking about. It's a weeknight win that delivers juicy shredded meat infused with a smoky-sweet sauce. You get all that by tossing some chicken and BBQ sauce in the slow cooker. Eat it paired with your favorite sides, layered on a pillowy roll, or stuffed in a taco, then freezer the leftovers for another night.",
