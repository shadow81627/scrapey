Cook for a further 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through when tested with a skewer in the thickest part of the leg. Juices should be clear. If not, then cook for a little longer. Transfer chicken to a chopping board and stand for 10 minutes before slicing. Note: You can use bought breadcrumbs to crumb foods, but if you have a food processor it's easy to make your own. Remove the crusts from dayold white bread slices and cut into cubes. Transfer the cubes to the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped."
