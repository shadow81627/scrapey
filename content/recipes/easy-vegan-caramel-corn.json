      "text": "In a small saucepan, mix together the brown sugar, vegan butter, agave, salt, and cream of tartar. Put over medium heat and once you reach a foamy boil, cook for 1 to 2 minutes longer, stirring often with a non-stick spatula, being careful not to burn the sugar. Remove from heat and stir in the baking soda. The caramel will get lighter in colour and become very foamy."

      "text": "Pour the caramel over the popcorn, then stir the popcorn to coat. It's ok if the caramel isn't evenly distributed yet, you can continue to mix it as it bakes. Bake to popcorn for 1 hour, stopping to stir every 20 minutes to help evenly coat the popcorn. Let cool on the baking sheet, then break apart and store in an airtight container. It should stay fresh for up to a week"
