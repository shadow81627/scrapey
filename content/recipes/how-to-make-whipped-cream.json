  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Serving amount: Cream roughly doubles when it is whipped. One cup of cream will make about 2 cups of whipped cream, which is enough for 8 to 10 people to each get a healthy dollop on their pie. You can halve or double (or triple!) the amount as needed.Other flavorings: Before you start whipping, you can add orange or almond extract, a splash of liquor like bourbon or rum, some cocoa powder or melted chocolate, fruit pur√©e, or citrus zest.Note on whipping times: The times given above are using a stand mixer on medium speed. If you use a higher speed, the time between stages will be shorter. If you are whipping by hand, the times will likely be longer."
