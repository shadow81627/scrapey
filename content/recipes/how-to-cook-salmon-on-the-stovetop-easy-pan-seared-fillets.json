Above all else, resist the temptation to poke, prod, or move the fish; it's important that you leave it be. As the fish cooks, you'll notice the color of the fillet begin to lighten, starting at the bottom near the skin and slowly moving upwards. Cook the salmon undisturbed until the lighter-colored flesh has moved about 3/4 of the way up the fillets. This will come to a total time of 8 to 9 minutes for thick fillets and 6 to 7 minutes for thinner fillets."
