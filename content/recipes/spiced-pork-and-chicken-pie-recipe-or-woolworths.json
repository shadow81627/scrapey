    "1 onion, finely chopped",
    "1 pinch chilli flakes",
    "2 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "2 tsp ground allspice",

      "text": "Add the remaining oil and the onion to the same pan, and reduce the heat to low. Sweat gently for about 5 minutes until soft and translucent. Stir in the chilli flakes, cinnamon, allspice, and sausagemeat, breaking up the meat with a fork or the back of a spatula until it is crumbly. Increase the heat slightly, and saute for 10-15 minutes until the meat is no longer pink. Season well with salt and plenty of black pepper. Return the shredded chicken to the pan, and stir through until evenly mixed. Remove from the heat, and leave to cool."

      "text": "Halve the pastry, then roll out each piece on a floured work surface to fit the tart tin. Use one of the pieces of pastry to line the tin, allowing the edges to hang over the side. Lightly beat the 2 eggs, then stir into the meat mixture to bind. Add the cayenne (if using). Spoon the mixture into the pastry shell. Wet the edge of the pastry shell, and top with the other piece of pastry to make a lid. Press the edges together to seal, and trim away the excess. Using a sharp knife, make a hole or a slit on the top to allow steam to escape."
