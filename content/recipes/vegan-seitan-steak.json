Alternatively, if you do not have a food processor you can first mash the cooked lentils with a fork or potato masher, then add everything together in a large bowl and mix well."

It may be a bit crumbly at first, but keep kneading it for a few minutes until it comes together into a tight ball. Do not over-knead the dough, the more you knead it, the tougher the steaks will be, so knead it just until it comes together. Cut the ball into 4 sections, then use a rolling pin to roll out each section into 1/2\" thick steaks. The dough will be very tough and stretchy, but just keep working at it until you get your desired steak shapes."

Steam for 25 minutes, flipping the steaks halfway through so they steam evenly. They will double in size."

Remove the steaks from the steamer and coat in the marinade. Let marinate for a minimum of 30 minutes before cooking, or for as long as several days when kept in the fridge."

    "description": "In this video, Sam shows you her recipe for vegan seitan steak! This is the best vegan steak around. Seith steak is made from vital wheat gluten, which is the protein in wheat, and is also what makes pizza dough stretchy and elastic. Making this vegan steak from scratch allows us to infuse the vegan steak with tons of flavour. Finish off the vegan seitan steak recipe on the BBQ, in a grill pan, or by frying it. After that, you can enjoy it however you like! Vegan steak and chips, a vegan steak strips on a sandwich or a salad.",
