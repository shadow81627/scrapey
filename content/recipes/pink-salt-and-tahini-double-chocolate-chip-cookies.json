  "description": "A cookie recipe that doesn't call for a hand mixer? Sign me in!! All you need to mix these double chocolate chip cookies is a wooden spoon (or whisk), so no beaters to clean up. A little sweet, a little salty, a little nutty, and super fudgy, they might become your new favorite this holiday season!",
