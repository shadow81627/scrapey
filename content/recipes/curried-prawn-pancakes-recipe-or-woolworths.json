      "text": "Put the flour in a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt, stir, and make a well in the centre. Crack the egg into the well and add a tiny amount of the milk. Using a wooden spoon, stir the egg and milk, letting the flour gradually tumble in. Add the rest of the milk, little by little, stirring continuously until all the flour has been incorporated and the mixture is lump-free. Put it in the refrigerator to rest for 30 minutes, if you have time."
