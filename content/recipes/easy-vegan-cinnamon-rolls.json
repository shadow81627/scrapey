    "4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour",
    "2 tablespoons baking powder",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "1 cup vegan butter, (cut into small cubes)",
    "1 1/4 cup plant-based milk (such as soy or almond)",
    "1/4 cup vegan butter, (melted)",
    "1 cup brown sugar",

      "text": "Preheat your oven to 400F (200C). Line with parchment paper or grease a 9\"x 12\" baking dish. *Make sure you use a 9\" x 12\" pan or equivalent. For the cinnamon rolls to stay soft they need to expand into each other. If they have too much room around each roll, they can end up getting crispy. I used the one from this baking set."

      "text": "Make the dough: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Add in the vegan butter cubes and use a pastry cutter or fork to cut the butter into the flour until you reach a grainy texture. Pour in the plant-based milk and combine to make a shaggy dough."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Either in the bowl or on a clean work surface use your hands to knead the dough together incorporating any leftover dry ingredients until it all comes together into a nice ball. Let the dough rest in the bowl for 10 - 15 minutes before proceeding for the best dough texture. Resting allows the dough to get stretchy which is a must for gorgeous pull apart cinnamon rolls!"

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Cinnamon sugar filling: Pour the melted vegan butter over the rolled out dough and use a pastry brush or the back of a spoon to spread evenly over the dough. In a small bowl mix together the brown sugar and cinnamon, then sprinkle the cinnamon sugar evenly over the melted butter."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Roll your cinnamon rolls: Starting from a longer side of the dough rectangle, use your hands to gently roll the dough up. Once rolled, use a sharp knife to cut 12 cinnamon rolls by gently sawing with the knife. I like to mark out each bun by lightly scoring the surface of the roll before doing the final cuts, to ensure even sized cinnamon rolls."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Optional icing: Combine the powdered sugar, vegan butter, vanilla extract, and lemon juice or plant-based milk together in a small bowl. *I like using lemon juice to add a little bit of tang to the icing- similar to cream cheese frosting, but if you want an all sweet icing opt for plant-based milk. Spread the icing roughly over the still warm cinnamon rolls. The icing will melt into the cinnamon rolls a little. YUM!"
