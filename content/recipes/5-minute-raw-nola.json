  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 1/2 cups raw walnuts (I subbed 1/3 of this amount with sprouted almonds)",
    "15 - 17 pitted dates (I prefer medjool / fresh sticky dates work best here*)",
    "1 heaping Tbsp hemp seeds",
    "1 heaping Tbsp flaxseed meal",
    "1 tsp chia seeds",
    "1/2 cup shredded unsweetened coconut (I prefer desiccated)",
    "1/2 cup gluten-free rolled oats* (omit or substitute to keep truly raw)",
    "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 tsp maca powder ( (optional)",
    "1 pinch sea salt",
    "1/4 cup unsweetened cacao powder (or cocoa powder)",
    "2 Tbsp cacao nibs",
    "3 Tbsp roughly chopped dried fruit ( (e.g. bananas, cherries, or blueberries)",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract (or half this amount in vanilla powder)",
    "Dairy-free milk of choice (or store-bought)",
    "Fruit of choice (I liked banana best)",
    "Coconut Yogurt (or store-bought)",
    "Cacao nibs"
