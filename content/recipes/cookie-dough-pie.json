The dough will come together by pressing and mixing in 1 to 2 minutes. Add in the chocolate chips. Add more flour or maple as needed (sprinkle non dairy milk to help bind if needed). Use your hands to press the dough together if needed. Taste and adjust sweet. Add more sugar or oil to taste to the dough if it is too floury. Press the dough onto parchment lined or greased pie pan."
