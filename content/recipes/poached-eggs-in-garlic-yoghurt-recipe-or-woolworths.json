    "500g thick creamy yoghurt",

    "1 pinch salt",
    "1 pinch freshly ground black pepper",
    "2-3 tbs white wine vinegar",

      "text": "Fill a pan with 900 ml water, add the vinegar, and bring to a rolling boil. Stir the water with a spoon to create a mini whirlpool in the centre. Crack one egg into a small bowl and gently slip it into the water. As the egg spins and the white sets around the yolk, stir the water again for the next one. Poach each egg for 2-3 minutes, so that the yolks are still soft. Drain the eggs using a slotted spoon and place on top of the yoghurt base."
