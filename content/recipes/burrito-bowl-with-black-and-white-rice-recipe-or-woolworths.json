Use poultry or sharp kitchen shears to cut from the middle of the parsons nose, along the spine, through the ribs to the neck. Open the chicken and turn it over. Put the heel of your hands over the breastbone and press down firmly to fracture it, (just like doing CPR) this allows the chicken to sit flat and cook evenly."
