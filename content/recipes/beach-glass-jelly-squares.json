Gently warm the juice and gelatin over very low heat, stirring or whisking frequently until the gelatin is fully dissolved. This will happen quicker than you might expect: two or three minutes at most. Do not let the liquid bubble or boil. Tilt the pan from side to side and look for gelatin grains, or rub the mixture between your fingers; it should feel silky. Pour the juice into one of the prepared pans. Rinse out and dry the saucepan."
