    "description": "Here's how to get the crispiest Brussels sprouts thanks to the air fryer. \n\nThe air fryer has become my new favorite sous chef for cooking dinner side dishes, because I can be happily cooking away on the stovetop and it will ring a delightful ding when the food inside needs a flip or is done completely. Just about every vegetable I've air fried turns out sweeter, crunchier, and more flavorful than if I had roasted it. Brussels sprouts are no exception here and they get even more tender inside as their outsides crisp in the air fryer.\n\nSee full post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/air-fryer-brussels-sprouts-23002775)",
