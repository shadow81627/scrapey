With a metal fork, whisk the sugar with the bottom of the fork (tines flat to the pan) in a circular motion. Wear an oven mitt if the fork gets hot. Whisk until the sugar spreads out and begins to foam and bubble. Approximately 4 minutes. Add the Grand Marnier and the juice from the orange, whisk for 1 minute. Put the banana slices in, cut side down and cook for 1 minute. Flip the bananas and cook for another minute."

Stand as far back from the pan as possible, keeping your face and hands away from the pan. The flame will be a faint blue but will be very hot. It should extinguish in 5 to 10 seconds. Once the flame is out, hold the pan handle with an oven mitt, and gently shake the pan from side to side to coat the bananas with the sauce."
