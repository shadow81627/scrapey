Cambria, our Design Editor, swears by toasting frozen slices completely, until golden, and then making the grilled cheese.Ham &amp; Cheese: A timeless combo. I recommend cutting the ham into small squares before mixing it with the cheese â€” this makes the sandwich easier to eat.Bacon &amp; Cheese: Basically Ham &amp; Cheese, but...with bacon. Seriously good. Ditto on the advice to break the bacon into bits before assembling. Also, try this with some chopped tomato come summer.Caramelized Onion Grilled Cheese: Along with the cheese, add some caramelized onions. Crazy good.Three Cheese Sandwich: Grab three random cheeses from your fridge and ask yourself, &quot;Will this melt?&quot;"
