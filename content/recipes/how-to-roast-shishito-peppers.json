    "text": "Cooking oil: I prefer to use olive oil for this dish, though technically olive oil isn&#x27;t ideal for this kind of high-heat cooking. I just love its rich, savory flavor with the salty peppers. If you&#x27;d prefer to use something else, I&#x27;d go for grapeseed oil or even peanut oil.Dipping sauce: Make a simple dipping sauce for these peppers by mixing mayonnaise, sour cream, or yogurt with some lime or lemon juice and some hot sauce, like our Magic Summer Sauce."
