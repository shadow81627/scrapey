    "3/4 cup non dairy milk (such as almond, coconut, cashew or soy)",
    "3 to 5 tbsp coconut sugar or other sugar (depends on the sweetness of the bananas)",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1/3 cup cocoa powder",
    "2 tbsp oil (optional, use with gluten-free blends or for keeping muffins moist for longer storage)",
    "1 1/2 cup fluffed flour (scant) (I use 1 cup unbleached white flourand 1/2 scant cup whole wheat)",
    "2 1/4 tsp baking powder",
    "1/4 tsp baking soda",
    "1 tsp ground spices or spice blend of choice (I use 3/4 tsp cinnamon, 1/4 tsp nutmeg, a big pinch of ground cloves)",

If the mixture is stiff(depends on the type of flour and if the flour was compacted etc), fold in 1 to 2 tbsp non dairy milk. Alternatively, add the flour, baking powder, baking soda, spices and salt to the wet bowl and mix until just about combined. Fold in the oats and chocolate chunks in the batter in the blender or bowl. At this point or the while pouring into the pan, you can fold in additional almond butter or softened peanut butter for nut butter swirls in the muffins."
