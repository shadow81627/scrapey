    "3 Tbsp raw sugar (or sub brown sugar)",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1/2 Tbsp ground cinnamon",
    "1 Tbsp flaxseed meal (or whole flax seeds)",
    "1/4 cup coconut oil",
    "1/3 heaping cup maple syrup or agave (or honey if not vegan)",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract",
    "1 medium ripe banana (mashed // 1 banana yields ~1/2 cup)"

      "text": "Spread the mixture evenly onto one or two baking sheets (making sure it doesn’t get crowded // use additional baking sheets, as needed, if increasing batch size) and bake for 23-28 minutes or until golden brown. The coconut oil will help it crisp up well, but be sure to watch it carefully as it can brown quickly."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once the granola is visibly browned, remove from the oven and toss just a bit to let the heat escape. Cool completely on the baking sheet or in a heat-safe bowl. Store in a container or jar with an air-tight seal – it should keep for a couple of weeks."
