    "description": "A big Dutch oven is the perfect vehicle to make a stovetop casserole that has everything you'd want in a weeknight dinner. The rice here is perfumed with garlic, ginger, and chicken broth, and then frozen (yes, frozen!) shrimp and broccoli go straight into the pot. Everything steams together and turns into a meal that has it all: starch, protein, and veggies. To top it off, a super-quick honey and garlic sauce comes together while the casserole is cooking, then it's drizzled over each serving to add a touch of sweetness and another punch of garlic. If your freezer is already stocked with broccoli and shrimp, you can even decide on this dinner on the drive home from work.",
