      "text": "Brush potato slices with sriracha oil mixture and sprinkle with salt. Bake for 10–20 minutes—baking time depends on oven temperature and thickness of slices. It's really important that after 10 minutes, you check on these every minute or so because they go from perfectly done to burnt really quickly! They'll be done when the edges begin to brown—some parts may still be a little bit soft, but that's to be expected with baked potato chips. Serve right away—homemade potato chips don't store well."
