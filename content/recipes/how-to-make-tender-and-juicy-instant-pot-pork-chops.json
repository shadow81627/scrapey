    "4 boneless pork chops, preferably loin chops about 1-inch thick (about 1 3/4 pounds total)",
    "1 teaspoon kosher salt",
    "1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "1/2 cup all-purpose flour",
    "4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided",
    "2 large yellow onions, thinly sliced",
    "1 cup low-sodium chicken broth",

      "text": "Season the pork chops and coat in flour. Season the pork chops with the salt and pepper — be sure to coat the edges as well as both flat sides of each chop. Press the pork chops into the flour to coat each side. You might not use all the flour; be sure to discard any unused flour."

      "text": "Working in 2 batches, brown the pork chops. Set a 6- to 8-quart electric pressure cooker or Instant Pot to sauté and give it about 10 minutes to preheat. Add half of the butter. When melted, quickly add 2 of the pork chops and sear until browned, 2 to 3 minutes per side. The edges of the pork chops will brown the most on the first side. Transfer the browned pork chops to a clean plate. Repeat browning the remaining pork chops in the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter."

Using tongs, transfer the pork chops to a serving platter. Add the sour cream or yogurt to the sauce and stir to combine. Serve the pork chops smothered with the rich sauce."
