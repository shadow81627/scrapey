  "description": "Even though ratatouille tastes best in the summer with the abundance of eggplant, zucchini, and tomatoes, it can be made and enjoyed all year long. In this ratatouille recipe we used green zucchini, yellow squash, eggplant, red peppers, onions, garlic and fresh tomatoes for an insanely delicious meal! Pro tip: use canned tomatoes for a wintertime ratatouille. Delicious and comforting! A sprinkling of savory herbs completes this classic French dish.\r\n&nbsp;",
