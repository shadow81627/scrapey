Divide it into quarters and flatten it down to around a 1/2 inch (2.5cm) thickness (I do this by hand, the dough is quite soft and sticky so dust it with flour to make it easier). You can either hand form or cut the scones with a biscuit cutter. Put the scones on the prepared baking tray and then into the oven."
