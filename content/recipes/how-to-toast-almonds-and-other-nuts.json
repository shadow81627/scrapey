    "text": "A note on alternatives: Nuts can be roasted in a toaster oven and I confess to doing this now and then. But be warned: they can easily burn in a toaster oven as the heating elements are much closer to the nuts than in a regular oven. Watch them closely! You can also roast nuts in a skillet on the stove top but I find that they seldom roast evenly with this method. Usually there are browned places where the nuts have contacted the hot skillet and pale places where they haven&#x27;t. An oven assures an even, all-over browning.Chopping: If the recipe requires chopping, do this after roasting. It is frightfully easy to burn already chopped nuts since the pieces are so small. Warm nuts also chop more cleanly and with less flaking.Pine nuts: Smaller nuts such as pine nuts are notorious for burning quickly. I check them more frequently, usually every 2 minutes or so."
