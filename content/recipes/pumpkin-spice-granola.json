    "15 oz can solid pack pumpkin pur√©e ($1.29)",
    "1/2 cup brown sugar ($0.24)",
    "1/4 cup vegetable oil ($0.08)",
    "2 Tbsp honey ($0.24)",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract ($0.28)",
    "2 tsp pumpkin pie spice ($0.30)",
    "1/2 tsp salt ($0.02)",
    "6 cups old fashioned rolled oats (not instant oats) ($1.03)",
    "1/2 cup dried cranberries, chopped ($0.74)",
    "1/2 cup raw unsalted sunflower seeds ($0.60)"

      "text": "Spread the oat mixture over one or two baking sheets covered with parchment paper. Bake the oats in the preheated oven for 45-60 minutes, or until they are mostly dry. Stir the oats once at 30 minutes, and again at 45 minutes. The amount of time needed to bake the granola will depend on how thick they are piled onto the baking sheet. If using one baking sheet it will take about an hour, if they're spread between two sheets, it will take about 45 minutes."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once the oats are finished cooking, sprinkle in the chopped cranberries, stir, then press and pack the mixture down onto the baking sheet to cool. Packing it down before it cools helps solidify the granola and create chunks rather than individual flakes. Once cool, store in an air-tight container for up to a week."
