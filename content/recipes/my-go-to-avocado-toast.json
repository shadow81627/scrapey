The perfect plant-based breakfast or snack.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/my-go-to-avocado-toast/\n\nWe love avocado toast, but we definitely don’t claim to have invented it! The exact origin of avocado toast is debated, but both a restaurant owner from Sydney, Australia and a chef from New York City claim the credit. Bill Granger of Sydney claims it was on his menu in 1993 and Chloe Osborne claims to have tried it in Australia in 1970 and brought it to her Manhattan restaurant menu in 2006.\n\nIt’s possible though that neither of them actually invented it. There’s evidence that avocado smeared on toast was mentioned in newspaper and magazine articles as early as the 1920s and it’s been a common combo in Chile and Peru as far back as the 1800s.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
