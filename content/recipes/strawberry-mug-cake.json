    "9 tablespoons all purpose flour (strong white flour in the UK) (, plus more for dusting your surface. I like to use unbleached flour )",
    "3/4 teaspoon baking powder",
    "2 tablespoon sugar (, lighter coloured varieties are best)",
    "1 pinch salt",
    "enough water",
    "3 medium fresh strawberries",
    "3 tablespoons natural powdered sugar",
    "a few drops water, plant-based milk or lemon juice (, no more than a teaspoon)",
    "a a tiny dab of oil for greasing the mug (, I used coconut oil (OPTIONAL _ omit to make oil-free)"

      "text": "First make the frosting. In a small bowl mix the powdered sugar with either water, plant-based milk or lemon juice. Add the liquid a tiny bit at a time. It doesn't take much at all. Literally a few little drops. You need much less than you will think you do so do it very gradually drop by drop. The most you will need is 3/4 teaspoon of water, perhaps a tiny drop more if you are using milk. Stir well until smooth and pretty thick like in my video then set aside. If you accidentally add too much liquid add a little more powdered sugar to thicken it up again."

Use your hand to knead it a couple of times to bring it together. If you need a tiny drop more water because it's too dry just add it little by little. If you accidentally go too far and it's a bit sticky add a small sprinkle of flour."

      "text": "Pour over 1/2 a teaspoon of water then place in the microwave uncovered and cook on full power for around 1 min 10 seconds. My microwave is 1200 watts. You will need to adjust the time a bit up or down depending on the strength of your microwave and the first time you make this it will be a bit of a case of trial and error. All microwaves are different so be careful not to overcook it. If you overcook it it will become tough so be sure to check how powerful your microwave is first and adjust accordingly. The very maximum time it will need is about 1 min 25 seconds and that is only if you have a really low powered microwave. A tiny bit under done is better than overdone as then it will go tough. If it needs longer cook in 5 second increments to avoid over cooking it."

It will be cooked in the middle and it will continue to cook for a little while once removed from the microwave. Don't make the mistake of thinking it's not done and cook it for too long."
