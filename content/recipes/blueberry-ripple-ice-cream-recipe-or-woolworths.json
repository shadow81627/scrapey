Put the mixture in a blender or food processor, blend until completely smooth, then pass it through a nylon sieve into a bowl to get rid of the tiny blueberry pips. Leave to cool."

Transfer the ice cream to a wide, shallow plastic container and pour the ripple over the surface in thick, irregular lines. Use a chopstick to swirl it through the ice cream. Freeze until needed."
