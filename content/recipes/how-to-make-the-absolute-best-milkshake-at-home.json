    "1 pint ice cream (about 2 cups)",

    "1 tablespoon strawberry jam",
    "1 tablespoon vanilla or chocolate syrup",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract or espresso powder",

Let 1 pint ice cream sit out at room temperature until starting to soften, 10 to 15 minutes (softened ice cream will blend with ease and require less milk to get things moving). Give the container a squeeze — it shouldn’t be rock hard and should give slightly when it’s ready. Meanwhile, chill the glasses and prepare any mix-ins."

      "text": "Chill your glasses and chop any mix-ins. If you have room in your freezer, stick 2 tall drinking or milkshake glasses in there, or else chill the glasses in the refrigerator. This will ensure the milkshake stays cold as long as possible. Coarsely chop until you have 1/2 cup mix-ins of your choice, you want the pieces to be about 1/2-inch."

Stop the blender and scrape down the sides or stir as needed to keep things moving. You want a final consistency that pours like lava."
