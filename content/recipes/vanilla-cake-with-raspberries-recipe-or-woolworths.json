Spread cooled cake with frosting. Cut into squares and decorate with raspberries. Tip 1: Slab cakes are great for cutting into shapes for decorating, it is best to use day old cakes, refrigerated overnight as they tend to be less crumbly when cut. Tip 2: Use a level-based slab pan or roasting dish. If the cake cooks faster around the edges, reduce oven temperature and increase cooking time. Tip 3: Use a pastry brush to remove any cake crumbs that fall onto the board or platter around the cake before and during decorating."
