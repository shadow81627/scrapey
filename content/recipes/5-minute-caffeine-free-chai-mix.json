Use a spoon to mix spices into water (or skip this step if blending). Then add warmed dairy-free milk of choice to your mug (or blender) and stir (or blend) to combine. The spice mix can settle to the bottom, but blending really helps! Keep a spoon handy to give it a stir when drinking if the spices need to be dispersed."
