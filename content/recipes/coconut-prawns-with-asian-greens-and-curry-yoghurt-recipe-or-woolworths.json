      "text": "Heat 2 tablespoons of the oil in a large deep frying pan over medium-high heat. Cook half the prawns, for 1-2 minutes each side or until golden and cooked through. Transfer prawns to a plate. Cook remaining prawns adding more oil if required. Carefully wipe the pan clean with paper towel."

      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Heat same pan over medium-high heat. Add remaining tablespoon oil, tomatoes and pak choy and stir-fry for 1-2 minutes or until tender. Serve prawns with vegetables, curry yoghurt and lime wedges. Tip 1: Shake the pak choy a little after washing but leave some water clinging as this helps create steam when cooking. Tip 2: These coconut prawns also make great party food; served just with the curry yoghurt. You can substitute Gold curry mayonnaise for the curry yoghurt. Tip 3: Green prawn cutlets are also sold in 1kg bags in the seafood freezer. Thaw them on a baking paper-lined tray in a single layer in refrigerator overnight."
