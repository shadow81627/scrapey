  "recipeIngredient": [
    "36 (15 oz / 414 grams) chocolate sandwich cookies (, such as Oreos or Newman O's (use gluten-free Oreos to make the recipe GF)",
    "9 tablespoons (135 mls) melted vegan butter",
    "1 cup (240 mls) canned coconut milk (, must be full fat not light)",
    "13 oz (360 grams) dairy-free chocolate (, bars or chips)",
    "1 1/2 cup (180 grams) powdered sugar (, icing sugar in the UK)",
    "3 tablespoons (22 grams) cocoa powder",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons fine sea salt (, not table salt)",
    "1 tablespoon (15 mls) apple cider vinegar",
    "1 tablespoon (15 mls) vanilla extract",
    "(OPTIONAL) 2 teaspoons finely ground espresso (, or any other finely ground coffee beans)",
    "3 x 8 oz (227 grams) vegan cream cheese (, Tofutti works best)"

      "text": "Grease the base of a 9-inch springform pan with a little vegan butter, then lay a large square of parchment paper over it. (To scale the recipe down to fit a 6-inch pan see the recipe notes). Press it with your hands to stick it down onto the butter. Then clip the sides onto the pan over the paper so the excess paper sticks out around the edges. There is a picture of this in the post above. By doing this, when the cheesecake is set, you can easily pull it off the base of the pan and slide it onto a plate or cake stand, then pull the paper out from under it once it's in place. If you don't have a springform pan and are using a loose bottomed push up pan, line the bottom with a circle of paper."

If you don't have a food processor put the cookies in a ziplock bag, seal it making sure to squeeze out the air, then bash them with a rolling pin."

      "text": "Once the chocolate mixture has cooled, add the powdered sugar, cocoa powder, salt, apple cider vinegar, vanilla and optional espresso powder. Stir briefly. Don't worry about mixing it in properly, you just want the powdered ingredients to be wet so they don't fly everywhere when you beat the cream cheese in."

      "text": "Add the cream cheese, and using an electric mixer beat on low until everything is combined, then turn up the speed to high and keep beating for another 3 to 4 minutes to trap lots of air in the mixture and make your filling lighter."

Level the top with a spatula, make some nice swirly patterns, then place in the fridge to set for at least 4 hours. TIP: Place a dinner plate or some cling wrap over the top of the pan just in case someone drops something on it. (I ended up with a brussels sprout embedded in the top of mine the first time I made it ðŸ¤£)"
