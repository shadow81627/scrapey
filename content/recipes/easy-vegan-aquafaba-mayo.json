  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1/4 cup aquafaba (the liquid/brine in a can of cooked chickpeas)",
    "1/4 tsp ground mustard",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar",
    "1-3 tsp brown rice syrup* (or sub stevia to taste, cane sugar, or OR maple syrup)",
    "3/4-1 cup sunflower oil* (a neutral oil is important here for flavor // avocado also worked well and we've heard canola does, too)"

      "text": "Add aquafaba to a tall glass jar along with ground mustard, sea salt, apple cider vinegar, and brown rice syrup. Blend on high with an immersion blender for best results (we haven't had good success with traditional blenders)."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Measure the oil in a liquid measuring cup. Then, with the immersion blender on its highest speed, slowly stream the oil in over the course of 1-2 minutes. Doing so supports the immersion process."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Move the immersion blender up and down to incorporate a little air toward the end. If it's looking too thin, add more oil. The more oil you add, the creamier, thicker, and denser the texture will become. You shouldn't need more than the recommended amount."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more sweetener of choice for sweetness (keeping in mind maple syrup will make it less thick + fluffy), vinegar for tanginess, salt for saltiness, or ground mustard for mustard flavor. I added a bit more of each."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Use immediately or transfer to a sealed container in the refrigerator until cold - about 4 hours. It will thicken even more in the fridge! Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 2 weeks (sometimes longer). You'll know it's gone bad when mold has formed. Not freezer friendly. Perfect for sandwiches, dressings, sauces, and more!"
