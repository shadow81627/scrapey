On a large sheet pan add the peppers, onion and chickpeas (I like to keep my peppers and chickpeas separate for aesthetic reasons but you can also just mix everything together) and toss together with olive oil and spices. I like to use a really large sheet pan to bake this meal since itâ€™s a lot of food and it cooks faster, but you could also separate it onto two pans if you have smaller ones."
