    "description": "Taco seasoning is a pantry essential, adding rich, spicy flavor to anything it touches. In addition to seasoning taco meat, it can be used a million different ways: as a dry brine for big cuts of meat, a seasoning for casseroles, and a flavor booster for chili, just to name a few. Making your own taco seasoning at home is as simple as whisking together some pantry ingredients. It gives you complete control over its flavor, tastes way better than anything that you can buy, and saves you from having to go to the store in the first place.\n\nHere’s how to make the very best taco seasoning at home — and how to use it for tacos and beyond.\n\nSee full recipe [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/taco-seasoning-recipe-23023048)",
