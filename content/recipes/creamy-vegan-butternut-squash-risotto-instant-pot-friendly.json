  "recipeIngredient": [
    "6 cups butternut squash, peeled and cut into ~3/4-inch cubes (1 large squash yields ~6 cups or 850 g)",
    "3 Tbsp olive oil (DIVIDED)",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 large bulb garlic",
    "2 Tbsp vegan butter (we used Miyoko’s // or sub olive oil)",
    "1 cup uncooked arborio rice",
    "1/4 cup dry white wine (such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Gris)",
    "2 cups water",
    "1 (14-oz.) can light coconut milk",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1/4 cup vegan parmesan cheese (plus more for topping // or sub store-bought)",
    "1/2 cup pine nuts",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil",
    "3/4 cup chopped fresh sage (30 medium leaves yield ~3/4 cup or 24 g)",
    "1/8 tsp sea salt"

      "text": "SQUASH: Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (218 C) and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss the cubed butternut squash with 2 Tbsp olive oil and 1/4 tsp salt, then spread in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet."

      "text": "For the roasted garlic: Slice the top off the garlic bulb, exposing the tops of the garlic cloves. Place on a small square of foil or parchment paper and top with the remaining 1 Tbsp of olive oil. Scrunch up the foil/paper to seal in the garlic and place the wrapped bulb on the baking sheet with the squash. Roast everything for 35-40 minutes, tossing the squash chunks halfway through the cooking time. The squash should be tender and golden/caramelized in places. After 40 minutes, remove the squash from the oven and place the foil-wrapped garlic directly on the oven rack for an additional 10 minutes."

      "text": "TOPPING (optional): Toast the pine nuts in a dry skillet over medium heat until lightly golden. This should take about 5 minutes — watch them closely as they go from untoasted to burned quickly! Once toasted, transfer to a mortar and pestle and crush the pine nuts slightly. You should still have some whole pine nuts. Alternatively, use a food processor and pulse briefly."

      "text": "In the same skillet or saucepan, heat 1 Tbsp olive oil over medium heat. Add the chopped sage in as even a layer as possible, and don’t stir. It should sizzle immediately and begin to darken and “fry” slightly. Sauté for a few minutes, stirring infrequently, to brown the sage slightly (this allows the flavor to deepen). Be careful not to let it burn."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Transfer the sage to the mortar and pestle and crush the leaves to combine them well with the pine nuts. Add the salt (1/8 tsp) and toss with a spoon. Set aside your topping until ready to serve."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "RISOTTO: When the squash and garlic are about halfway done roasting, start the risotto. Using a 6-quart or larger Instant Pot, turn on the sauté function (to the default \"Normal\" — not high or low) and add the vegan butter. Once melted, add the rice to the butter and stir to coat. Spread the rice into an even layer on the bottom of the pot and let it sizzle lightly for a minute to toast, then turn off the sauté function by pressing “Cancel.” Add the white wine and cook for 1-2 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the liquid is absorbed."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Add the water, coconut milk, and salt. Stir, making sure there is no rice stuck on the bottom or sides of the pot. Put on the Instant Pot lid and set the valve to Sealing, if applicable (some models seal automatically when the lid is turned). Pressure cook on HIGH for 8 minutes. The Instant Pot will take about 10 minutes to pressurize, then will begin counting down. When the timer goes off at the end of the cook time, manually release the pressure. Stir the risotto to combine — it may seem a bit watery, but it will thicken as it cools."

Mash well with a fork, along with 1/3 of the roasted squash. Add this squash/garlic purée to the finished risotto, along with the vegan parmesan, and stir well to incorporate."
