    "2 packets frozen dragon fruit* (unsweetened // we like PitayaPlus brand)",
    "1/2 cup frozen raspberries (or other fruit of choice)",
    "2 medium ripe bananas (previously peeled, sliced, and frozen)",
    "3 Tbsp Vegan Vanilla Protein Powder (right now, we like Nuzest and Tropeaka)",
    "1/4 - 1/2 cup dairy-free milk (we used DIY Coconut Milk)",

      "text": "To a high-speed blender, add frozen dragon fruit, frozen raspberries, banana, protein powder, and dairy-free milk (starting with lower end of range). Blend until creamy and smooth. The trick to a thick smoothie bowl is being patient and blending slowly, adding only as much liquid as necessary, and using a smoothie wand (or something comparable that's blender safe) to scrape the sides down as it blends."

      "text": "Best when fresh. Store leftovers in the refrigerator up to 24 hours. Freeze for longer-term storage. Or freeze in ice cube mold to use in future smoothies."
