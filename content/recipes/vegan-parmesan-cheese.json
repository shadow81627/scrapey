This lets it dry out and allows the flavours to develop. If you need to rush it, place the cheese carefully, on the parchment paper, in the freezer. After about 30 minutes you should be able to grate or shave it."

It can be used (grated/shaved) while still frozen. Make sure the cheese is well chilled before crumbling or grating. If you accidentally leave it out of the fridge for too long and it gets a bit soft, simply pop it in the freezer for 10 minutes or so. For nice clean shavings, it is better for the cheese to be frozen."
