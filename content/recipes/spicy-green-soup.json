      "text": "In a large soup pot, heat 2 tbsp (30 ml) vegetable broth on medium-high heat. Add the Brussels sprouts and cook for 5 minutes, stir occasionally. Add the cauliflower and cook for 5 more minutes, stirring occasionally. Add the ginger and garlic and stir. Cook for 2 minutes. Add the broth and water, stir well and bring to a boil. Add the peas and cook for 15 minutes, or until the cauliflower is fork tender. Add the parsley, basil, lemon juice, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Blend with an immersion blender or use a stand-up blender, until smooth and creamy. There will be some specks of the parsley, which makes it even prettier to look at."
