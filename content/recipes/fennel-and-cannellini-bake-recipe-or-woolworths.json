      "text": "The anise flavour of the fennel becomes much milder when cooked, but retains a lovely aromatic smell. If I am making this as a main meal I add cooked chicken pieces, sausages (any flavour but pork and chicken are amazing with it) and pork chipolatas are a favourite with the younger kids. Bacon pieces, peas and butter beans are also a good match with the fennel."
