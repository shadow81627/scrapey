    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",

If not you will need to blend a little more up. Save any remaining to eat, or add to a smoothie, and return the 1/2 cup/110g of pineapple puree to the blender. It's important to get the right amount of pineapple puree so don't just eye ball it."

With all of the acid in the batter it will react quite quickly and you don't want to hang around before putting them in the oven. All of the bubbling action will make lighter cupcakes. So add it and blend it up on high speed for a few seconds then proceed to the next step immediately."
