Add a few lettuce leaves to each pita and fill with 1/2 cup of the chickpea salad mixture. Recipe makes 8 half pita sandwiches. A serving size can either be one half pita or two half pitas, depending on how hungry you are. If you donâ€™t use the entire mixture for dinner it can easily be stored in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."
