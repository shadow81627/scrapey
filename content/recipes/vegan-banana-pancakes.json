    "1 medium (7-8 inch) ripe spotty banana (, ( 1/2 cup or 120g when mashed)",
    "1 cup (240 ml) plant milk",
    "2 tablespoons + 1 teaspoon (35 ml) oil or vegan butter",
    "1 1/2 cups + 2 tablespoons (200 grams) all purpose flour",
    "2 tablespoons sugar",
    "1 tablespoon baking powder",
    "1/4 teaspoon baking soda (bicarbonate of soda in the UK)",

You might need to stop and scrape down the sides once. Don't over blend. Turn off the blender as soon as everything is smooth and combined. I pour my batter straight into the pan from the blender jar."
