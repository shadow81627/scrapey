    "~3/4 tsp ground cinnamon, divided",
    "2-3 Tbsp coconut sugar, divided (or sub brown sugar, but it will no longer be refined sugar-free)",

    "2-3 Tbsp maple syrup, divided",

Then shake a light dusting of cinnamon on each potato, followed by ~1 tsp coconut sugar, 2 Tbsp pecans, and a drizzle of maple syrup (focusing the syrup on the pecans) over all the sweet potato halves.NOTE: You could also add some mini marshmallows at this point if you're feeling sassy (but it will no longer be refined sugar-free)."
