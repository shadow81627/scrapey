    "description": "Baked Turmeric Lentil Fritters, Tomato, Greens Bowl with Tahini Dill Sauce.\nðŸ’™ FULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2017/01/turmeric-lentil-fritters-tomato-bowl-tahini-dill-sauce.html\nðŸ’™ My Book: https://veganricha.com/vrek\n\nThese Golden Seed and lentil fritters are amazingly easy. Cook the lentils with turmeric and spices, fold in some spinach or greens, add seeds like chia, flax, sesame or hemp or other of choice, chill, scoop into bite size fritters, bake and done.\n\nThe lentils when cooked make a wet mixture, which bakes up perfectly into crisp on the outside Golden fritters, soft and flavorful on the inside. I use a cookie scoop to make the fritters as it takes just 5 minutes without any mess. Tahini dill sauce complements these fritters incredibly well. Some juicy tomatoes and baby greens make this bowl an amazing meal. I eat up those fritters right off the baking sheet with the dill sauce, they are so good! so you might want to double the recipe. You can also make wraps with these life a falafel wrap. Some crunchy lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, fritters and sauce in a warm pita bread. \nVegan Nut-free Soy-free Recipe.
