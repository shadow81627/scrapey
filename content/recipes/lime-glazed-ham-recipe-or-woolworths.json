Lay lime slices onto ham and secure using cloves or toothpicks. Transfer to a carving board or platter and slice. Note: For the wow factor, replace your cooked limes with slices of fresh lime. You can keep the skin in the refrigerator and use it to cover the ham for storing as this will help to keep it moist."
