      "text": "Softening the cashews (optional): Softening the cashews first helps them blend. If you have a high-powered blender you can skip this step, but if not, this step is important to get a smooth and creamy dip. To soften the cashews add the cashews to a small pot, cover with water, and boil for about 10 minutes until the cashews are very tender. Drain and rinse cashews before using."

      "text": "Add the cashews, 3/4 cup water, lemon juice, nutritional yeast, apple cider vinegar, dried oregano, and salt to a blender or food processor. Blend until completely smooth and creamy stopping to scrape the sides as needed. If your dip is too thick or difficult to blend, add 1 tablespoon of water at a time, adding more as needed until you reach desired consistency. Serve the dip with a sprinkle of garnishes as desired, and a side of pita triangles, veggies, or chips for dipping. Store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to 5 days. The dip will get slightly thicker once cooled."
