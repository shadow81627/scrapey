    "text": "Substitutions: Gruyère or cheddar cheese can be used in place of Manchego. Drained canned corn can be substituted for frozen corn (although it will be slightly sweeter). Make ahead: You can make the corn batter without the egg whites up to 1 day in advance and refrigerate in an airtight container. Let come to room temperature before adding the beaten egg whites. Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for 3 days. Reheat in a 350°F oven for 8 to 9 minutes."
