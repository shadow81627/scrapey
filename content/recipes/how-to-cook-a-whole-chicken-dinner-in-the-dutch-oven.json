    "description": "We can all agree on the perfection of a roast chicken dinner. Juicy, tender chicken, a crackle of golden chicken skin, all on top of a bed of supple, caramelized vegetables. It's hard to think of a more iconic poultry dish, except for maybe Thanksgiving Turkey. This Dutch oven roasting trick was something I picked up while working on a cookbook a few years ago. In his book, EverydayCook, Alton Brown roasts a whole turkey inside a Dutch oven, which cuts down on the roasting time and keeps the turkey from drying out. While you'll need a specific Dutch oven for a Thanksgiving bird, an everyday Dutch oven can turn chicken into an inspired all-in-one dinner.",
