  "description": "While bread is satisfying to make, it is a lengthy process and can be quite difficult. Cornbread rises with baking powder, not yeast, so is quicker to prepare and easier to produce. Young bakers should start out with easy recipes such as this. Adding sweetcorn to the batter is another thing guaranteed to please children and adults alike.",
