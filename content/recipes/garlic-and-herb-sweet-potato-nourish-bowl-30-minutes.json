  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 medium sweet potato, halved (skin on)",
    "1/4 tsp avocado oil",
    "1 cup finely chopped parsley",
    "1/3 cup chopped red bell pepper or cherry tomatoes",
    "3 Tbsp diced red onion",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice",
    "1 healthy pinch each sea salt and black pepper",
    "1/2 batch 4-Ingredient Dill Garlic Sauce",
    "2 cups chopped romaine (we like romaine hearts)",
    "2 Tbsp hummus (or store-bought)",
    "1 Tbsp sauerkraut (or sub store-bought)",
    "1 Tbsp tahini",
    "2-3 tsp za’atar (or sub store-bought)",
    "Lemon wedges (optional)",
    "1 Tbsp dulse (or other sea vegetable or sprout of choice // optional)",
    "Chili garlic sauce (optional)"

Add halved sweet potato and rub with a little oil to coat (if your sweet potato is large, cut into quarters or large wedges to speed bake time). Then bake for ~25 minutes or until tender."

      "text": "In the meantime, prepare parsley salad by adding parsley, red bell pepper, red onion, lemon juice, salt, and pepper to a small mixing bowl and tossing to combine. Add more lemon or salt to taste if needed. Set aside."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Next, prepare dill garlic sauce by adding the hummus, lemon juice, fresh or dried dill, and minced garlic to a small mixing bowl and stirring to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding salt to taste (only if needed), lemon juice for more acidity, garlic for bite, or dill for a more intense herb flavor. If the flavors are too strong, dilute with a little hummus. The sauce should be pourable, so add a bit of water to thin if needed."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Best when fresh. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator, keeping the sauce and sweet potato separate from the greens / parsley salad. Sweet potatoes will last for 2-3 days, greens for 3-4 days, and sauce for 4-5 days. Reheat sweet potato in a 375 degree (190 C) oven or on the stovetop over medium heat until hot."
