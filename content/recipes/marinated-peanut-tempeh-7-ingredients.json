    "1 whole fresh or dried bird's eye chili (minced/crushed // or sub 1/4 tsp red pepper flake)",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp sesame oil (if avoiding oil, leave this out and add a bit more lime, soy sauce, and maple syrup)",
    "2 Tbsp salted creamy peanut (or almond, cashew, or sunbutter)",

      "text": "To remove bitterness from the tempeh, add to rimmed skillet or saucepan filled with 1 inch of water and bring to a low boil over medium heat. Steam tempeh for a total of 10-12 minutes, flipping once at the halfway point. Then rinse, pat dry, and cut into thin, bite-size pieces. I prefer slicing the tempeh in half lengthwise then cutting into small triangles. (The smaller the pieces, the better they can soak up the marinade.) Set aside."

      "text": "Mix marinade by adding chili, sesame oil, peanut butter, tamari, lime juice, and maple syrup. Whisk to combine. Taste and adjust flavor as needed, adding more crushed chili for heat, maple syrup for sweetness, lime juice for acidity, or tamari for saltiness. Don't be shy - you want this extremely flavorful!"

      "text": "Add the sliced tempeh to the marinade and toss to coat. Then cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, preferably 24 hours. I found that 24 hours infused the most flavor! While marinating, toss/stir occasionally to ensure even coating. (Pro tip: Just before baking, drizzle with a bit more maple syrup and tamari for extra flavor. Optional but recommended!)"

Vegan + gluten free.\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/marinated-peanut-tempeh-7-ingredients/\n\nTempeh and peanut sauce both have roots in Indonesian cuisine. Tempeh is a fermented soy product thatâ€™s made of cooked, dehulled soybeans that are inoculated with mold, packed, and incubated until the beans are bound together by the mycelium. Sounds like weird science, but this fermentation process creates prebiotics which have been known to promote gut health.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
