Remove from the heat, stir through the breadcrumbs and parsley, season, and set aside to cool. Preheat the oven to 200°C. Sit the turkey in a large roasting tin, and season, inside and out. Spread the remaining butter over the skin. Stuff the onion quarters into the body cavity, and the stuffing into the neck end. Roast for 20 minutes, then reduce the oven temperature to 190°C."
