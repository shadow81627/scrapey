  "description": "This vibrant Beet Hummus is deliciously creamy, earthy, sweet, and tangy. The key to the amazing flavour is to roast the beets and onion so they sweeten and caramelize before being blended up with the chickpeas. Enjoy this healthy, flavour-packed vegan dip with veggies, pita bread, chips or as part of a meal.",

    "1/4 cup / 60 mls extra virgin olive oil (, plus more as necessary (see notes for oil-free)",
    "1 x 15 oz can / 1 3/4 cups canned chickpeas (, (or 1 x 398ml Canadian can / 400g in UK)",
    "3 cloves garlic (, use 4 if you like extra garlicky hummus )",

    "5 tablespoons lemon juice (, about 1 medium lemon)",
