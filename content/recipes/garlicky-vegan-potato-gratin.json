Blend on high until very smooth with no bits of cashews remaining, scraping down the sides as needed. This takes about 1-2 minutes. Transfer to a mixing bowl and add the finely chopped rosemary.

Transfer the slices to your baking dish of choice and arrange them in spirals, or rows, where they are close together with no large gaps (see photos). Repeat until all the potatoes are coated in sauce and arranged in the dish. Pour any remaining sauce over the top of the potatoes and jiggle the dish side to side to get the sauce to settle between the potatoes."
