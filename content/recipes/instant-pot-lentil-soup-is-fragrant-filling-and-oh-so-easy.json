    "description": "Just the thought of lentil soup makes me warm with comfort. You see, I have a very clear vision of what I expect when I think about this soup. It all stems from the New York City deli where I was first introduced to this soup over a decade ago, and eventually learned to expect the same brothy, warmly spiced bowl studded with vegetables most places I ordered it. \n\nThese days I'm making it at home rather than ordering it, but it is the cozy, crave-worthy lentil soup I've been enjoying for years: A perfectly spiced brothy soup with a hint of smoky warmth, filled with tender lentils that are soft, but not mushy, and a scattering of thick-cut carrots and celery, and ribbons of bright spinach.\n\nAnd perhaps best of all, I created a quick-cooking version (with no saut√©ing or leftover ingredients!) that's wildly simple to pull off and leaves you with plenty of freezer-friendly leftovers for days to come. \n\nSee full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/instant-pot-lentil-soup-23105244)",
