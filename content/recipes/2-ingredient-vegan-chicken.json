  "description": "Making 2 ingredient vegan chicken is fun and although it&#039;s a bit time-consuming, each step is actually pretty easy, and the results are SO worth it. This is the most chicken-y vegan chicken I have ever tasted!! Washed flour seitan is chewy and juicy. The seitan pulls apart into shreds that are perfect for snacking on, or you can add them to practically any dish- pasta, sandwiches, salads, soups, wherever you like!This technique has been documented in China since the 6th century so there are many recipes and variations, but this recipe was mostly inspired by The Pot Thickens video Washed Flour Seitan Recipe from Start to Finish",

Dump the dough out onto a clean work surface and knead the ball of dough well for 5 - 8 minutes. If the dough is too sticky, sprinkle the dough with flour as needed. Alternatively, if you have a mixer with a dough hook you can use this to knead the dough."
