  "recipeIngredient": [
    "14-ounce package extra-firm tofu (pressed for at least 30 minutes and cut into 16 spear-shaped pieces)",
    "2 tablespoons avocado or peanut oil",
    "6 tablespoons creamy peanut butter",
    "2 tablespoons lime juice",
    "1 tablespoon tamari",
    "2–3 teaspoons light brown sugar or coconut sugar to taste",
    "1 tablespoon ginger juice",
    "1 tablespoon water",
    "4 large whole grain sandwich wraps or tortillas, warmed",
    "1 small carrot, peeled and shredded",
    "1 small red bell pepper, cored and cut into thin strips",

Cook for about 5 minutes on each side until lightly browned and crisp. Transfer the tofu to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb excess oil. Set aside."
