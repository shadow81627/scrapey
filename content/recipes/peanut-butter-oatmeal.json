  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Microwave: To make this oatmeal in the microwave, combine the milk or water, maple syrup or honey, kosher salt, and oats in a large microwave-safe bowl. (The oatmeal will bubble up a lot, so make sure to use a large enough bowl.) Stir to combine and make sure the oats are completely covered by the liquid. Microwave on HIGH power until bubbling and about 2/3 of the liquid has been absorbed by the oats, 2 1/2 to 4 minutes. (The oatmeal will still look very runnythis point.) Let the oatmeal sit for 5 minutes in the microwave. Add the peanut butter and stir to combine.Storage: Leftover oatmeal can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. When reheating, add more milk or water to help thin out the oatmeal as needed."
