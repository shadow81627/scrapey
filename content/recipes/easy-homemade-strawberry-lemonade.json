Taste and adjust as needed, adding more agave for sweetness and to balance the lemon, lemon juice for tartness, or strawberries for more strawberry flavor."

You can also serve over ice, though it will dilute the flavor a bit. Serve this lemonade on its own or as a mixer with tequila, gin, or vodka."
