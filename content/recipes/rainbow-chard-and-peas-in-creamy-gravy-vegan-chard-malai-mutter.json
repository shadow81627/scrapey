    "description": "Rainbow Chard and Peas in Creamy gravy. Chard /Methi Matar Malai Vegan. Dairy-free creamy greens & peas w/ indian spices, somewhat like spinach dip\nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2014/01/rainbow-chard-and-peas-in-creamy-gravy.html\n\nOne of my favorite ways to eat Fenugreek used to be Methi Malai Matar (Fresh Fenugreek leaves and Peas in creamy buttery sauce). The sauce generally has a good amount of cream, butter and sometimes grated Paneer cheese. This version of course, does not use any of that, it has non dairy subs and also uses Rainbow chard which is much more easily available in the Northwest. Some dried Fenugreek leaves help add the Methi flavor and result is amazingly delicious. Hence, Chard Malai Mutter. Think a spinach artichoke dip but more of a side. You can serve it like a dip with chips too. Spiced Indian style greens, peas and cream dip. Or Serve with Naan. \n\n#veganricha #easyveganrecipes #meethimatarmalai #creamedchardandpeas #veganindian\nMusic Epidemic Sound.",
