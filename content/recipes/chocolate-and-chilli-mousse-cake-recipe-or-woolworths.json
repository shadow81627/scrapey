Melt the chocolate and butter in a heatproof bowl set over a saucepan of gently simmering water, stirring occasionally, making sure the water doesn't touch the base of the bowl. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar in a bowl with a hand-held electric whisk until pale and thick. Stir in the melted chocolate mix."

Fold a couple of tablespoons of the egg white into the chocolate mixture to loosen, then fold in the remaining egg white with a metal spoon. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake in a preheated oven, 180°C for 20 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover with foil (to prevent a crust forming) and leave to cool. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 4 hours or overnight."
