      "text": "Take chicken from the buttermilk, without shaking off too much excess milk, and coat with dry ingredients. Place chicken straight into oil for frying. Fry @ 180 degrees for 4 minutes. It is best to do these in small batches just before frying, otherwise the flour coating soaks up too much milk and doesn't get as crunchy"
