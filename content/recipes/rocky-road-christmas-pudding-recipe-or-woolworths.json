      "text": "Get a pot of water on the stove, start bringing it to the boil. While this is happening, break your white chocolate into smaller pieces.You can even use white chocolate bits or melts which ever is your preference works just fine. Also now is great time to cut your lollies into smaller bits. The spearmint leaves I find cut in half are a good size and stick to the top well. Raspberry lollies can also be cut smaller too, or put on whole."
