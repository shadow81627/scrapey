  "recipeIngredient": [
    "2 1/2 cups (312 grams) all purpose, spelt or whole wheat flour",
    "1/2 teaspoon baking soda (, (bicarbonate of soda in the UK)",
    "2 1/2 teaspoons baking powder",
    "2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
    "1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt",
    "1/2 cup (120 mls) melted vegan butter or oil (, vegan butter gives the best flavour. See recipe notes for oil-free option)",
    "1 cup (200 grams) white or cane sugar",
    "3/4 cup (180 mls) unsweetened plant milk",
    "1 tablespoon apple cider vinegar (, or lemon juice)",
    "1 tablespoon vanilla extract",
    "2 medium apples (, peeled, cored & diced (approx 2 cups or 215 grams once diced)",
    "1/4 cup (60 mls) melted vegan butter",
    "Packed 1/3 cup (64 grams) brown sugar (, light or dark)",
    "1 heaping tablespoon (15 grams white or cane sugar",
    "2/3 cup (84 grams) flour (, (the same flour you used for the muffins)",
    "OPTIONAL 1/2 cup (75 grams) chopped pecans or walnuts"

      "text": "To a medium bowl add the melted butter, brown sugar and white/cane sugar. Stir to combine. Add the flour to the butter mixture and using a fork (do not use a spoon or spatula), gently toss everything together to form a mix of sandy, small, medium and large clumps, making sure to incorporate all of the dry flour. It's good for it to be really irregular with clumps of all different sizes. Be careful not to over-mix it because you'll end up breaking up the clumps. Pop the streusel in the fridge to set while you make the muffins."
