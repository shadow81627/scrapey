      "text": "Test thickness by taking some out with a small spoon and cooling it. You can also drizzle some on a cold plate (cool it in the freezer) and if it hardens then it’s ready. It will thicken more as it cools. If you want this thick caramel that will firm up a bit then you really want to reduce it for about 10 minutes and check with the spoon method. You can also use a candy thermometer and make sure it gets to 225 degrees for a thick result that will firm up better. If you want it more of a runnier sauce, then cook for around 5 minutes."
