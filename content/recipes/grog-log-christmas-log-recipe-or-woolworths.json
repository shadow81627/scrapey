      "text": "Notes1. I prefer to use silver pearls instead of the old fashioned silver cachous.these new pearls are way more gentle on your teeth. 2. To create a beautiful stripy pattern, slice on an angle. 3. I used butternut snap biscuits for my recipe but you can use chocolate ripple or for the gluten intolerant folk any gluten free biscuits.4. I have used lactose free cream and lactose free cream cheese but ordinary cream and cream cheese is fine. Experiment and have fun."
