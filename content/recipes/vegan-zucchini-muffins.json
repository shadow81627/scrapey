    "1 1/2 packed cups (310 grams) grated zucchini (/ courgette)",
    "1/2 cup and 2 tablespoons (150 mls) plant milk (, unsweetened)",
    "1/2 cup (120 mls) liquid oil",
    "1 tbsp apple cider vinegar",
    "1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract",
    "2 1/2 cups (312 grams) all purpose flour (plain flour in UK) (, or spelt or wholewheat flour)",

    "2 1/2 tablespoons ground flaxseed",
    "2 1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg",
    "3/4 teaspoon fine salt",
    "heaping 1/2 cup (100 grams) golden raisins or sultanas",
    "heaping 1/2 cup (82 grams) walnuts or pecans",

Fill right to the top then sprinkle a generous amount of sugar onto the top of each one. This gives them a delicious, crunchy sugary top. Or skip the sugar and add some optional streusel topping."

(If using the optiona streusel add on an extra minute). Starting at a higher temperature then lowering it is key to good muffins so don't cook them any other way."
