Transfer the mixture to a large bowl and let cool to about 110 degrees (approximately the temperature of bath water). Once cooled, add in the yeast, stir and let sit for 10 minutes.

You may not need the entire 4 cups or you may need to add in as much as another 1/2 cup. Form dough into a ball, cover with plastic wrap and let sit in a warm place for 1 hour."

Place the cranberry jelly in a small bowl and used a spoon to mash it up a little bit. Add the cranberry to the glaze and mix again until everything is combined. Spoon large spoonfuls of glaze over each cookie. Cinnamon roll cookies are best when served warm."
