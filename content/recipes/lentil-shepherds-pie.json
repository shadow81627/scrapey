    "1000g / about 6 large potatoes (, I love Yukon Gold for this)",
    "1/2 teaspoon salt",
    "1/3 cup / 80 mls non-dairy milk (, unsweetened )",
    "vegan butter",
    "2 teaspoons olive oil (optional - use water to sauté to make the recipe oil-free)",
    "1 medium onion (, chopped finely)",
    "4 cloves garlic (, chopped finely)",
    "1 large carrot (, peeled & diced)",
    "2 1/2 teaspoons dried herbs",
    "2 1/2 cups / 190 g cooked green or brown lentils (, (NOT red lentils)",
    "2 tablespoons arrowroot or cornstarch (, (cornflour in the UK)",
    "3 tablespoons tamari or soy sauce (, or coconut aminos or liquid aminos)",
    "1 cup / 240 mls canned crushed tomatoes or passata (if you only have whole or diced tomatoes just blend them up until smooth)",
    "1 cup / 240 mls mushroom or vegetable stock",
    "1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (, or to taste)",

Put the chopped potatoes in a large pan and cover with hot water from a kettle. Add the salt, cover and bring to the boil. Simmer for about 15 minutes until the potatoes are very tender (check with a fork or knife). Drain then return to the pan and leave them alone with the lid off for a few minutes to allow them to steam dry."

      "text": "Spoon the mashed potatoes over the top of the lentil mixture, then using a fork spread it out evenly. A few little gaps around the edges are fine. Rough the potato up with the fork (the rough bits create more crispy bits). At this point you can brush it with a little oil or vegan butter for even more crispiness, or just leave it as it is."
