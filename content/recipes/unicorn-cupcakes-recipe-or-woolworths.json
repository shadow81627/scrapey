      "text": "For the ears, roll out 50g of fondant 2mm thick and cut out small circles using a 2cm cutter. Shape to slightly oval and pinch each end to form ears. Place onto a plate and leave to dry. For horns, divide remaining fondant in half and colour half with yellow food colour. Using your palms, roll each to a long thin roll. Twist one of each roll together like a rope. Cut into 6cm lengths and roll one end thin for the point of horn. Leave to dry overnight. Add ears and horns to cupcakes."
