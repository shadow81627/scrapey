    "1 (2-3 lb) sugar or pie pumpkin (or sub 2 cups (450 g) canned pumpkin puree*)",
    "1 Tbsp avocado or coconut oil (optional )",
    "2 cloves garlic*",
    "2 Tbsp arrowroot starch",
    "1-1 1/4 cup unsweetened plain almond or rice milk (start with lower end of range)",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "2-3 Tbsp chopped sage or thyme (I used half thyme, half sage)",
    "4-5 Tbsp nutritional yeast",
    "3-4 Tbsp vegan parmesan cheese",
    "1/4 tsp pumpkin pie spice",
    "1/4 tsp red pepper flake or cayenne pepper (optional)",
    "10 ounces gluten-free pasta",

In the last 20 minutes of roasting, add the two cloves of garlic still in skin to the baking sheet to slightly brown and soften. Then remove pan from the oven and let the pumpkin cool. Also peel garlic cloves and set aside."
