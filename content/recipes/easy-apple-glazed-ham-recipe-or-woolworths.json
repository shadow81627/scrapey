Remove from oven, then, when cool enough to handle, carefully run knife under the skin, around the edge of the ham. Gently lift off the skin in one piece by running your fingers between the rind and the fat. Score ham with horizontal lines spaced 1cm apart. Add apple and onion to pan. Brush ham with one third of the glaze."

If ham should begin to burn or colour too much, cover loosely with foil. Place ham, roasted apples and onions on a platter and serve scattered with rosemary sprigs."
