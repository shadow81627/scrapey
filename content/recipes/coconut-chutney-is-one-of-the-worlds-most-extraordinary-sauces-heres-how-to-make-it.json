    "text": "Chana dal: If you have chana dal that is not already roasted, you can soak it in hot water for 15 minutes. An equal amount of blanched almonds or almond flour/meal can be substituted as a last resort.Storage: The chutney is best served fresh, but will last a few days in the refrigerator. Mix in a little water or lemon juice to loosen it up before serving."

When the popping starts to subside, add 1/2 teaspoon skinned urad dal. Stir to coat with the oil and reduce the heat to medium-low.
