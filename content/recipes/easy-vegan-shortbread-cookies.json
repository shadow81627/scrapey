The cookie dough can be made ahead of time and even frozen if you like for easy cookie prep. Perfect for all the holidays: Christmas, Easter, Valentine&#039;s Day, or on any old day with a cup of coffee or tea.Lightly adapted from Preppy Kitchen.",

Wrap the dough in plastic wrap or parchment paper and chill in the fridge for an hour or until firm. The dough can be stored in the fridge like this for up to 4 days."
