    "1 head garlic (to roast)",
    "3/4 cup raw cashews",

    "Salt + pepper (to taste)",
    "4 medium-large portobello mushrooms (organic when possible)",
    "3 Tbsp avocado or olive oil",
    "1/4 cup balsamic vinegar",
    "1 Tbsp Italian seasoning (dried basil + oregano)",
    "2 cloves garlic, minced (2 cloves yield ~1 Tbsp or 6 g)",
    "1 healthy pinch each salt and black pepper",
    "1 medium white or yellow onion, peeled + sliced into 1/4-inch rings",

Set directly on an oven rack and bake for 1 hour. Let cool before use. Note: To save time, you could buy roasted garlic, or sub the head of roasted garlic for 3-4 additional cloves raw garlic and proceed as instructed."
