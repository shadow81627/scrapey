    "2 tablespoons olive oil",
    "1 teaspoon salt",
    "1 large yellow onion (thinly sliced)",

Meanwhile, in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the bread hook attachment, combine 2 cups of bread flour, olive oil, salt, and remaining water. When the yeast becomes foamy, add it into the bowl with the flour. (If the yeast doesn't become foamy, it may be dead and you'll have to start over with new yeast.)"

Mix on medium-high speed for 4 minutes. Cover lightly with plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 30 minutes."

Top with 1/3 cup of the barbecue sauce, spreading it around the dough and leaving a 1/2-inch edge for the crust. Top with the grated cheese and the vegetable chickpea mixture. Drizzle with 1-2 tablespoons of additional barbecue sauce, or to taste."
