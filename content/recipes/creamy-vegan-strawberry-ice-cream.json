    "2 cups sliced strawberries (as ripe as possible for best flavor)",
    "1 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "1-2 Tbsp water (or orange juice)",
    "1 1/2 tsp cornstarch",
    "2 (14-ounce) cans full fat coconut milk (ensure it’s a quality brand*)",
    "1/4 cup raw cashew butter",
    "1/4 cup maple syrup or agave nectar (or sub all organic cane sugar)",
    "1/4 cup organic cane sugar (or sub all maple syrup)",
    "1 Tbsp pure vanilla extract",
    "1/2 tsp xanthan gum (for creamier texture // if you don’t have, omit)",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil or avocado oil (optional // for a bit of added creaminess)",
    "2 Tbsp minced fresh ripe strawberries (optional)"

      "text": "The day before, make the compote. (Making the day of is fine, too — it just needs a little time to cool). Add all compote ingredients to a small saucepan (sliced strawberries, maple syrup, water or orange juice — starting with lesser amount — and cornstarch) and stir to combine."

If the strawberries aren’t producing much liquid, add the remaining 1 Tbsp (15 ml) water or orange juice. Mash lightly with a spoon or potato masher and set aside to cool. If making the day before, cover and refrigerate until ready to use."

Blend for 1 minute or until completely creamy and smooth, scraping down sides as needed. Then add most of the strawberry compote, reserving ~3 Tbsp of compote (mostly liquid) for swirling later. Blend again until smooth and well combined."

      "text": "Add the slightly chilled mixture to your ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions — ours took ~20-25 minutes. It should look like loose soft serve. Once it reaches soft serve texture, add in your minced raw strawberries (optional) and churn for 1 minute more to disperse (see photo)."

Option to add reserved 3 Tbsp compote liquid and swirl with a spoon or knife. Top with parchment paper (or seal with a lid) and freeze for at least 4-6 hours or until firm — usually overnight."
