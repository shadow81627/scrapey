  "recipeIngredient": [
    "15 jumbo shells (gluten-free for GF eaters)",
    "1 tsp olive oil",
    "3/4 block firm tofu (slightly patted dry // 3/4 block yields ~1 1/4 cup)",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp vegan basil pesto (shouldn’t contain cheese)",
    "1 pinch sea salt",
    "1/2 cup dairy-free mozzarella cheese shreds (such as Go Veggie or Daiya)*)",
    "1/2 large eggplant (cut into 1/4 inch rounds)",
    "1 1/2 cups favorite marinara sauce"

      "text": "FOR THE EGGPLANT: Sprinkle eggplant rounds with sea salt and place in a colander over the sink to let drain. After 10 minutes rinse lightly and then pat dry. Slice into quarters, place on a cookie sheet and toss in olive oil and sea salt. Broil for 5-10 minutes or until slightly browned and softened, tossing once or twice to ensure even roasting. Set aside."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Next, bring a pot of water to a boil and add shells and a pinch of sea salt. Stir once and cook according to package instructions. Also, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 C)."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "While the shells are cooking, add tofu to a food processor and pulse a couple times to break it up. Then add pesto, a healthy pinch of sea salt, dairy-free mozzarella shreds and mix until just combined. Taste a little and see if you need more salt or pesto. Then stir in roasted eggplant."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once the shells are done, drain and let cool slightly. Pour 1/2 cup red sauce in the bottom of a 10-inch cast iron or 8×8 pan (amounts as original recipe is written // adjust if altering batch size), then stuff shells with generous spoonfuls of filling."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Arrange shells split side up in the pan and then top with remaining tomato sauce – they should be covered but not drowning. Bake for 35 minutes or until warm and bubbly. Serve immediately. These go great with Caesar salad, steamed broccoli and/or garlic bread."
