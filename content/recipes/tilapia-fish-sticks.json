When the pan is very hot it is ready for the fish (a drop of water will sizzle furiously when dropped in the skillet). Place half of the sticks in the pan and cook on each side until golden brown in color. Drain the fish sticks on a plate covered with paper towel. Wipe out the pan, add the rest of the vegetable oil (2 Tbsp) and cook the second half of the fish sticks the same way."
