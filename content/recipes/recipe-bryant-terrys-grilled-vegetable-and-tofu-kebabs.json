    "28 ounces extra-firm tofu",
    "5 cups barbecue sauce, like a double batch of Pomegranate-Peach Barbecue Sauce",
    "4 ounces small round potatoes, halved",
    "3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for oiling",
    "1 tablespoon freshly squeezed lemon juice",
    "1 large clove garlic, minced",
    "1 teaspoon coarse sea salt",
    "Pinch of cayenne pepper",
    "1 medium globe eggplant (about 1 pound), cut into 1-inch chunks",
    "1 medium green bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares",
    "1 large red bell pepper, cut into 1-inch squares",
    "1 large red onion, cut into four pieces vertically, then halved crosswise"

Let sit for at least 20 minutes (a 28-ounce can of tomatoes works well). Drain away the liquid and cut the tofu into 1-inch to 1 1/2-inch cubes. Put the tofu and 2 cups of the barbecue sauce in a large bowl and toss gently until the tofu is evenly coated. Transfer all the contents of the bowl to a ziplock bag and refrigerate overnight."
