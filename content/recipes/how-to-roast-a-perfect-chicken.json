    "text": "Storage: Leftovers will keep for about 5 days in the refrigerator or can be frozen for up to 3 months.Seasoning: You can change the flavor of the chicken by adding a spice rub along with the salt and pepper. We like Chinese 5-spice blend, za&#x27;atar spices, and ras el hanout.Roasting with vegetables: You can also make a two-in-one meal by roasting the chicken on top of a bed of potatoes, onions, carrots, or other veggies. Take a look at this recipe for instructions and inspiration: Viking Chicken."

It's an infallible Sunday dinner, and the leftovers (if you're so lucky) can be used for sandwiches, salads, and quick meals all week long. Roasting a chicken doesn't have to be a special weekend affair, either. A small bird really only takes about an hour to cook, so we can easily make it on a weeknight. Put it in the oven when you get home from work and let it cook while you wind down from the day. It's that simple — and here's how.",
