Sift the flour into a large bowl, add the caster sugar, butter, and eggs and mix with an electric hand whisk until well combined. Whisk in the coconut, lime zest, and lime juice. Spoon into the tin and level the top. Bake for 1-1 1 / 4 hours, or until risen and firm to the touch. Leave to cool for 5 minutes in the tin, then cool completely on a wire rack.
