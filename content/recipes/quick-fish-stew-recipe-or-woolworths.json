Let it simmer for a couple of minutes, then add the tomatoes (squashing them with a fork) and a little of the stock, and simmer a little more. Pour in almost all of the remaining stock, and bring to the boil. Reduce the heat slightly, and simmer for 10 minutes. At this point, you can blend the sauce with a hand-held blender until smooth, or leave it as it is. Top up with the remaining stock if it needs it."
