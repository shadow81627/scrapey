  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: The cookie dough can be refrigerated for several days before baking. It can also be scooped out onto baking sheets, pressed with a thumbprint, frozen solid, and stored in resealable freezer bags in the freezer for several months. Frozen cookies can be filled with jam and baked straight from the freezer, but may need 1 to 2 minutes extra baking time.Storage: Store the cookies in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days."
