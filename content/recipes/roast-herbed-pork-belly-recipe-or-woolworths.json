      "text": "Place the pork on a cutting board, skin-side up, and score the rind at 1 inch intervals (with a very sharp knife). Turn the meat over, skin-side down, and season with salt and pepper. Rub the herb mixture all over the flesh. Roll the pork up and tie it tightly with string. Rub the skin all over with the remaining oil, then a generous amount of salt."

Allow the meat to rest for 10 minutes before carving and serving. The Braised Black Cabbage & Beans or the Braised Artichokes & Potatoes would make great accompaniments for the pork."
