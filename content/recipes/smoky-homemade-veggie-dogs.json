    "1/4 teaspoon toasted sesame oil",
    "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated garlic",
    "1/4 teaspoon freshly grated ginger",
    "Hotdog buns",
    "Sriracha mayo (optional) I just mixed some vegan mayo with sriracha to taste.",

    "1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar",
    "1/2 teaspoon maple syrup",
    "1/4 teaspoon salt",

      "text": "Add the tofu to the bag and lay flat on a plate or in a baking dish. Make sure marinade is covering all the tofu evenly. I like to flip mine over a few times to make sure it gets everywhere. Marinate tofu for at least 2 hours, but the longer the better."
