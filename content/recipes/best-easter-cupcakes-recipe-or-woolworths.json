Tip 1: Un-iced cupcakes can be frozen for up to 6 weeks, wrapped individually and thawed overnight in the fridge. Tip 2: To test if cupcakes are cooked, insert a skewer and if it comes out clean it is cooked. Tip 3: To prevent the butter mixture from curdling, make sure the eggs are at room temperature."
