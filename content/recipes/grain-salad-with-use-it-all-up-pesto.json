Alternatively, the pesto and vegetables can be made up to 1 day ahead and refrigerated in separate airtight containers.Grilling: The vegetables can be cooked, covered, in a preheated skillet over direct medium heat (about 350ÂºF) on an outdoor grill for 5 to 7 minutes.Storage: If the rice was prepared the same day as the dish, leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days. If the rice was prepared the day prior, refrigerate and eat leftovers within 24 hours."
