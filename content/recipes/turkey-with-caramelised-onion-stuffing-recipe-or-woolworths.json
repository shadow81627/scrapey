      "text": "Fill front and back cavities of turkey with stuffing. Use kitchen string to tie the legs together. Use skewers to secure the wings. Pull neck flap tightly underneath and secure with a skewer. Place on wire rack in pan. Brush with extra melted butter. Roast following packet instructions, allowing 45 minutes per kilogram. Baste every 30 minutes with butter and pan juices, until cooked through. Cover wing tips and drumsticks with foil if browning too quickly. Transfer to a chopping board, cover with foil. Stand for 10 minutes and remove skewers before carving. Note: You can use bought breadcrumbs to crumb foods, but if you have a food processor it's easy to make your own. Remove the crusts from day-old white bread slices and cut into cubes. Transfer the cubes to the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped."
