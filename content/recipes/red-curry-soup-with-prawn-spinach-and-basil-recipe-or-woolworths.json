Immediately reduce heat to medium-low. Add snow peas, capsicum and return the prawns to wok. Simmer for 4-5 minutes until prawns cooked through. Add the spinach and basil."

      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Divide the noodles between 4 serving bowls. Ladle over the soup, scatter over extra basil leaves, bean shoots and lime wedges. Tip 1: You can replace coconut cream with coconut milk but do not boil as it may curdle. Tip 2: Frying off the curry paste cooks out all the raw ingredients like garlic, chilli and ginger which reduces spiciness and softens the curry. Tip 3: Press the un-used curry paste down into the base of the jar and drizzle vegetable oil over the surface, this keeps the paste longer. Use the oil on top for cooking the next curry."
