    "1 small head bok choy (stem and leaves separated, stem diced and leaves thinly sliced)",
    "1 bunch scallions or green onions (thinly sliced)",
    "1 tbsp coconut sugar (or light brown sugar)",
    "2 and 1/2 tbsp soy sauce or tamari",
    "1 and 1/2 tbsp sriracha or other chili sauce (plus more to taste)",
    "1/2 tbsp toasted sesame oil",
    "1/4 tsp ground white pepper",
    "1/2 tbsp rice vinegar or other light vinegar",
