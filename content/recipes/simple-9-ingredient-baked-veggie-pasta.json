    "12 ounces vegetable Penne pasta",
    "28 ounces crushed tomatoes",
    "1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil (optional, you could use 1/4 cup of water to sauté the onions if desired)",
    "1 medium yellow onion – finely chopped",
    "4 cloves of garlic – finely minced",
    "8 ounces mushrooms – sliced",
    "2 teaspoons of dried Italian seasoning",
    "1/4 cup of balsamic vinegar",
    "1 teaspoon of kosher salt",
    "Black pepper to taste",
    "3 cups of chopped spinach leaves",
    "1 cup of chopped basil leaves.",

The pasta should be firm and have a slight bite to it because you’re going to bake it later. If you’re going to eat it immediately without baking then cook it for 10 to 11 minutes. Drain the water when done."

      "text": "Add the olive oil to a large skillet and heat on medium high heat. When the oil (if you use water instead of oil add it when the pan is hot, then add the onions and mushrooms immediately) is hot add the onions and mushrooms and spread them out evenly in the pan. Stir occasionally so the onions don’t turn brown. When the onions are translucent and the mushrooms have released their water and are beginning to shrink add the garlic and cook for three minutes. Stir well. Add the tomatoes, Italian seasoning, vinegar, salt, and pepper. Stir to combine and bring to a boil. Once boiling reduce to a simmer. Add a 1/2 of a cup of the pasta water and stir. This will add a little starch to the sauce and thicken it a bit."
