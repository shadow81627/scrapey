    "text": "Halving the recipe: If serving a smaller crowd, this recipe can easily be halved. Use 4 tablespoons butter, 8 ounces celery, 1 (14.5-ounce) can low-sodium chicken or vegetable broth, 1 tablespoon soup mix, and 12 ounces bakery croutons. Dot with 1 tablespoon butter and bake in an 8x8-inch baking dish. Make ahead: The stuffing can be completely assembled, topped with butter, covered tightly with buttered aluminum foil, and refrigerated overnight. When ready to bake, let the baking dish sit out at room temperature while the oven heats. Bake for the same amount of time.Storage: Leftovers can be refrigerated in an airtight container for up to 4 days of frozen for up to 1 month."
