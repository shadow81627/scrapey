Spread the pea pesto over the dough in an even layer, leaving a 1-inch border for the crust. Sprinkle evenly with the artichoke hearts and the mozzarella slices. Place the pan in the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the bottom starts to look golden brown. Remove the pizza from the oven and sprinkle with red pepper flakes and black pepper, to taste. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing."
