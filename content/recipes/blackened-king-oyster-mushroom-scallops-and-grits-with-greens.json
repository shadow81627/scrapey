    "4 large king oyster mushrooms",
    "2 cups warm water",

    "1/4 teaspoon dried thyme",
    "1/4 teaspoon salt",

      "text": "Begin by slicing the mushroom stems into 1-inch thick pieces. (You can discard the caps if you want. I used them, because even though they don't look like scallops, they still taste good!). Stir the water, soy sauce, garlic and dulse flakes, if using, together in a small bowl. Add the mushroom pieces. Soak for at least 1 hour, or up to 12 hours."

      "text": "When the mushrooms are done soaking, remove them from the liquid and blot dry. Stir the paprika, pepper, oregano, thyme, salt and cayenne together in a small bowl. Coat the bottom of a medium skillet with oil and place it over medium heat. When the oil is hot, add the mushroom slices in an even layer and sprinkle the tops with about half of the spice mixture. Allow to cook for about 4 minutes, until lightly browned on the bottoms. Flip and sprinkle the other sides with the other half of the spice mixture. Cook about 4 minutes more, then flip once more to sear the spices on the bottoms. Remove the mushroom slices from the skillet and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate."
