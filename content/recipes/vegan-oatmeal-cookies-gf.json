    "3/4 cup almond flour or almond meal",
    "3/4 cup rolled oats (certified gluten-free as needed)",
    "1/4 cup gluten-free flour blend (or sub unsweetened desiccated or shredded coconut, but cookies will be less fluffy)",
    "1/4 cup raisins (or other dried fruit)",
    "3/4 tsp baking powder",
    "1 tsp ground cinnamon",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1/3 cup packed organic brown sugar (or sub coconut sugar)",
    "1/4 cup aquafaba (the brine/liquid in a can of chickpeas // if not vegan, sub egg whites)",
    "2 Tbsp almond butter* (or other nut or seed butter)",
    "2 1/2 Tbsp avocado or melted coconut oil*"

      "text": "To the aquafaba, add the almond butter and oil and beat or whisk to combine. (The mixture will deflate a little — that's okay). Then add to dry ingredients and mix until combined. You should have a firm, semi-tacky dough (see photo). If not baking immediately, cover and chill in the refrigerator for up to 2-3 days (the cookies will develop a bit more flavor and slightly firmer texture if the dough chills, but chilling this long is not necessary)."

      "text": "Scoop dough into roughly 2-Tablespoon amounts (I like this scoop) and place on prepared baking sheet with about a 1-inch gap in between each cookie to allow for spreading. Press down slightly with your palm to form a disc. Then use fingers to tuck in any raisins that might be sticking out. There should be about 12 cookies."

      "text": "Store leftovers in a loosely sealed container at room temperature up to 2-3 days, or in the freezer for 1 month. We recommend storing them in the freezer once cooled to help retain their crispy exterior. These are so delicious when warm and dipped in homemade almond milk or a chai latte!"
