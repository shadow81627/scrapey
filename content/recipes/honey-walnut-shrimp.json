Slice all the way down the back of each shrimp halfway through to help the shrimp form their signature flowery curls during frying. This is best done by laying each shrimp on one side on a cutting board and running a sharp knife down the back, being careful not to completely sever the halves. Add the shrimp to the ginger."
