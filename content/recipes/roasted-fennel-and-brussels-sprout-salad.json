    "1 medium bulb fennel, fronds and stems removed, halved, core removed, and thinly sliced with a knife or mandolin",
    "1 lb Brussels sprouts, ends trimmed and halved (smaller sprouts cook best)",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil (see notes if oil-free)",
    "1/2 tsp each sea salt and black pepper",
    "1/4 cup slivered almonds",
    "2 Tbsp dried cranberries, chopped",
    "1/2 cup orange slices, peeled and pith removed, cut into thin 1-inch pieces",
    "2 Tbsp apple cider vinegar (or sub balsamic vinegar for a richer variation)",
    "1 Tbsp olive oil (if oil-free, omit)",

Spread in an even layer and turn the Brussels sprouts cut side down. If the veggies are crowded, use more baking sheets to encourage browning."
