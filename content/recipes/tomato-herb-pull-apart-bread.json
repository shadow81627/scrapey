Heat the oil and herbs over medium-low for 2-3 minutes to gently infuse the oil with flavor. It's okay for the herbs to sizzle, but do not let them burn."

Knead the dough for about 5 minutes, slowly adding more flour as you go, until a smooth ball of dough has formed and you've used about 3 cups of flour total (from beginning to end). Let the dough rest for 5 minutes."

Toss the dough pieces in the sauce and cheese until everything is evenly coated. If the dough pieces stick together before they get coated in the sauce, simply pull them apart."
