Dredge the tofu pieces in cornstarch, and when the oil is hot, transfer them to the skillet in an even layer. Cook about 10 minutes, flipping once or twice, until browned and crispy on multiple sides. Transfer the tofu to a paper-towel lined plate."

Raise heat to high and add the broccolini to the skillet. Stir-fry until bright green and tender-crisp, about 4 minutes. Return the tofu to the skillet and pour the sauce over everything. Flip a few times to coat the tofu and broccolini in the sauce. Remove from heat and sprinkle with green parts of scallions."
