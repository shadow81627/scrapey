Carefully drip off any excess back into the glass (they should be sparingly coated), and push the undipped end into the sugar in 1 of the glasses. Continue to dip all the breadsticks. (If you work quickly you could dip all 12 breadsticks in one go, but otherwise do half at a time.) Set aside until slightly tacky but not entirely set, about 20 minutes."
