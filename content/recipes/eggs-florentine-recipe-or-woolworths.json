Season it well and cook for a minute or two, stirring frequently, until it wilts completely. Drain well, squeezing out excess water, then return to the pan, mix in 2 tbs of the hollandaise sauce, and put the lid on to keep it warm."

Repeat for all the eggs. Poach gently for 3 minutes, until the white is set but the yolk still runny. Remove with a slotted spoon."
