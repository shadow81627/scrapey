Tip 1: To check if it is cooked, push the tip of a knife into the flesh; the fish will flake slightly when nudged with your finger. Pick up a piece and it should easily flake apart rather than holding firmly together. Tip 2: You can replace the salmon with ocean trout. The cooking time is the same. Tip 3: If your salmon has a thin tail end, fold it under itself to make the fillet an even thickness."
