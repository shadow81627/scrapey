      "text": "Place the bread in a hot pan and cook for 3 - 5 minutes per side until golden brown on both sides. It's best to cook the French toast slowly so that it gets crisp on the outside and cooks through to the middle. You will likely need to work in batches depending on the size of your pan. Serve hot with maple syrup, vegan butter, coconut whipped cream, and an extra sprinkle of pumpkin pie spice if desired."
