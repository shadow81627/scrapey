Place the chicken breasts in the marinade and flip them a few times to coat. Set aside to marinate for 15 minutes, flipping at the halfway point to marinate evenly."

Once the oil is hot and shimmering, add the chicken breasts to the pan. The pan should be hot enough that they sizzle nicely! Let them sear for 2-3 minutes, then flip and sear for another 2 minutes on the second side. Flip once more, turn off the heat, then pour the remaining marinade over the chicken breasts."

An oven thermometer is highly recommended as the bake time will vary based on the size of the chicken breasts (~10-12 minutes for 5-6 ounce breasts, ~12-14 minutes for 7-8 ounce breasts, and ~14-18 minutes for 8-10 ounce breasts)."
