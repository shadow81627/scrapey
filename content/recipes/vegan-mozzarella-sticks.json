When the oil is hot, place a cheese stick into the batter to coat, then transfer it to the breading, carefully rolling it around to coat. Place it in the skillet. Repeat for as many sticks will fit in the pan without crowding (leave a good 1 1/2 inches between them). Cook until browned and crisp on the bottoms, about 5 minutes, gently flip and repeat on the other side. Transfer the cooked mozzarella sticks to a paper-towel lined plate to drain."
