  "description": "Rabokki is served in bunsikjips, or snack shops, all across South Korea as more of a lighter bite; but it can quickly and easily stretch into a heartier main course.",

  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Rice cakes: There are two types of Korean rice cakes: one made entirely from rice and another made of rice and wheat flour. Both are interchangeable and are available at Asian or Korean markets. If you follow a gluten-free diet, use cakes fully made out of rice. Ramen: Any type of Korean instant ramen noodle block will work. I only stress Korean instant ramen here because the noodles tend to have a thicker diameter and are excellent for clinging onto the tteokbokki sauce. Using the ramen seasoning packet: If you cannot find dried anchovies and kombu, you can save the soup packet from the instant ramen and use that instead."
