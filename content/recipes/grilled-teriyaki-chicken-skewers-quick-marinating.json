  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1/3 cup soy sauce or tamari (ensure gluten-free as needed)",
    "1/4 cup coconut sugar (or sub brown sugar)",
    "1/4 tsp garlic powder",
    "1 1/2 tsp rice vinegar",
    "3/4 tsp toasted sesame oil",
    "1 1/4 lb. boneless, skinless chicken thighs*, trimmed of excess fat, cut into 1-inch chunks (organic, pasture-raised when possible)",
    "1/2 tsp arrowroot powder",
    "1/4 - 1/2 medium red onion, sliced into 1-inch chunks",
    "Avocado oil (for greasing grill pan)",
    "Sesame seeds",
    "Thinly sliced green onion"

      "text": "In a wide, shallow glass container, whisk together soy sauce or tamari, coconut sugar, garlic powder, rice vinegar, and sesame oil. Remove about 1/3 of the marinade (~2 1/2 Tbsp if making the default number of servings) and reserve for making glaze."

      "text": "Slice chicken thighs into ~1” chunks. Add to the container with the marinade, stir to coat well, cover, and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes to marinate. If preparing in advance, you can marinate in the refrigerator for up to 12 hours and let sit out at room temperature for 30 minutes before grilling (this takes the chill off and prevents the chicken from burning on the outside before cooking fully)."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "While the chicken is marinating, whisk together the arrowroot powder and a splash of water in a small saucepan, then add the reserved marinade. Bring to a simmer, whisking frequently until thickened to a glossy glaze — about 2-3 minutes. If it thickens too much, add a little water to thin. If it’s too thin, whisk more arrowroot with water, then add to the saucepan and cook to thicken."
