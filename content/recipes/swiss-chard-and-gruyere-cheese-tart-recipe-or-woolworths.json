Trim away the excess, line the pastry shell with greaseproof paper, and fill with ceramic baking beans. Bake in the oven for 15-30 minutes until the edges are golden. Remove the beans and paper, and brush the bottom of the shell with a little of the egg wash. Return to the oven for 1-2 minutes to crisp. Remove from the oven, and set aside. Reduce the oven temperature to 180°C."
