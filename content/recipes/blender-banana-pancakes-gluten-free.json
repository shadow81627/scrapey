    "1 Tbsp melted dairy-free butter or avocado oil (plus more for cooking)",
    "1 tsp vanilla extract (or sub another extract or citrus zest of choice)",
    "2 large eggs* (free-range, organic when possible)",
    "1/2 cup dairy-free milk (cashew and almond are best)",
    "1/3 cup oat flour (ensure gluten-free)",
    "1 cup almond flour (not almond meal)",
    "1/4 cup gluten-free flour blend (sub whole wheat, unbleached all purpose, or spelt if not GF)",

Wait 1 minute for the oil to heat, then pour on roughly 1/4-cup amounts of batter, only as many as will fit comfortably in the pan. Then cover and cook for 3 minutes or until the underside is golden brown, bubbles appear on top, and the edges appear dry."
