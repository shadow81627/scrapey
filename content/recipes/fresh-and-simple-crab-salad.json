    "text": "Make ahead: The crab salad can be made one to two days in advance, but crab tastes best when it’s fresh. Given this recipe’s quick prep time, you’ll reap the most rewards if you make it just before eating. Storage: The crab salad will keep for about 3 days in an airtight container in the refrigerator."
