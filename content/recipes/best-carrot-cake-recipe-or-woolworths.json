Decorate top of cake with extra almonds. Refrigerate for 20 minutes. Tip 1: The vegetables in this cake act as a moisture and sweet component rather than as flavourings. No need to squeeze out moisture. You can use 2 cups of carrots and omit the zucchini if you like. Tip 2: Baking this cake among 2 pans means a quicker cooking time and no need to slice a whole cake in half to have the layers. Tip 3: Store cake in the fridge, covered in an airtight container, for up to 5 days."
