      "text": "Carve slices from the sides of the turkey working towards the centre. This way each slice should also contain some of the stuffing. Remove legs and wings and carve off meat. Transfer to a serving platter. Serve. Note: You can use bought breadcrumbs to crumb foods, but if you have a food processor it's easy to make your own. Remove the crusts from dayold white bread slices and cut into cubes. Transfer the cubes to the bowl of a food processor and process until finely chopped. To cut the turkey, start by cutting the bank of the skin holding the drumsticks. Hold the end of the drumstick and place your knife between the drumstick, thigh and body of the turkey. Cut through the skin, now remove the entire leg by pulling it out and back (use the point of the knife to help disjoin it)."
