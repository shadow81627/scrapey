To check for doneness, insert the tines of a fork into the thickest part of the fillet and gently pull. If the fish flakes easily, then it is done. If it is still gooey, and if the fork is difficult to pull out, bake the salmon for 5 more minutes and check again."

      "text": "To serve the salmon, gently slide a spatula under the fish and remove it to a cutting board. Use a sharp knife to cut the fillet into four equal pieces. If desired, lift the fish away from the skin to serve. Serve with rice or fresh bread and a generous green salad."
