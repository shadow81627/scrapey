    "1/3 cup / 80 mls tomato ketchup",
    "1 tablespoon maple syrup",
    "3 tablespoons soy sauce or Tamari (, see notes if gluten-free )",
    "1 tablespoon sriracha (, or Sambal Oelek, or any other hot sauce or chili paste )",
    "1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil (, (omit to make oil-free)",
    "1 clove garlic (, minced or grated very finely)",
    "1 big pinch freshly ground black pepper"

Different blocks of tofu are different thicknesses but most you will get 2 or 3 slices. Take each of those slices and cut it into triangles. Lay the tofu triangles out in a large dish and set aside."

Keep an eye on it though as all ovens are different. If it starts getting too dark remove it a little bit earlier. You want it to be really caramelized (dark brown, almost black) around the edges and on the corners. Again keep any remaining glaze (there won't be much)."
