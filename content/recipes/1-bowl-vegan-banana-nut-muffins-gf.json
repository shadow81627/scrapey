    "1/4 cup coconut sugar or organic cane sugar",
    "1/4 cup packed organic brown sugar",
    "2 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "3/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1/2 tsp ground cinnamon (optional)",
    "3/4 cup unsweetened plain almond milk (or other dairy-free milk)",
    "1 1/4 cup almond meal",

Remove from oven and let cool in the tin for 5 minutes. Then remove from tin and let cool completely on a cooling rack. The wrappers peel away easier and the muffin texture is best when completely cooled."
