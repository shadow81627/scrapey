      "text": "Combine fruit in a large bowl. Spoon fruit into 1-cup freezer-safe containers with sealable lids. Cover with juice and freeze overnight until firm. Tip 1: When adding to lunch boxes, place fruit cups into a snap-lock bag so other items in the box donâ€™t get wet. The fruit will thaw before recess or lunchtime, but still be cold and slushy. Tip 2: A layer of yoghurt can be added to the base of the container before filling with fruit and juice, or set the fruit in jelly for a special treat."
