    "description": "A grain- and gluten-free alternative to traditional pizza with chickpea flour crust, vegan pesto, and sun-dried tomatoes! Just 10 ingredients required!\n\nFull Recipe: https://minimalistbaker.com/socca-pizza-with-sun-dried-tomatoes-pesto/\n\nSocca is a flatbread made from chickpea flour and its exact origin is hotly debated. Some claim it originated in the region that is now Nice, France. While others claim it was invented in Genoa, Italy (where it’s called farinata) or Marsielle, France (where it’s called panisse). Still other versions can be found in Sardinia, Gibraltar, Algeria, and Argentina.\n \nFOLLOW US!\nBlog: http://minimalistbaker.com/\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/minimalistbaker/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/minimalistbaker\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/MinimalistBaker",
