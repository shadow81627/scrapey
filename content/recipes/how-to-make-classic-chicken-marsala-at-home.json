    "description": "Nothing says fast and fancy quite like the Italian-American dish of chicken Marsala. A menu staple no matter the restaurant, this dish has seen its fair share of revisions. No matter the update, the pairing of golden, pan-fried chicken with a mushroom-studded Marsala wine sauce hasn't changed. We're throwing our hat in the ring with a version we just can't stop swooning over. With creamy sauce spiked with lots of garlic and, of course, the namesake Marsala wine, this take on chicken Marsala is next-level good. And while it might sound like a dish that requires hours of cooking, it is actually a super-fast, one-pan chicken dinner that is perfect for weeknight cooking. You can serve the chicken and Marsala sauce over angel hair pasta (just like your favorite Italian restaurant), over cauliflower rice, or, my favorite, with a simple Caesar salad.",
