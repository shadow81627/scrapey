Simply lay a clean dish towel over a mixing bowl, pour over the hazelnut milk, carefully gather the corners, and lift up. Then squeeze until all of the liquid is extracted. Discard pulp, or save for adding to baked goods. Find more inspiration for the pulp here."

Blend until well combined — about 1 minute. Taste and adjust if desired, adding more maple syrup for sweetness or cocoa powder for chocolaty goodness."
