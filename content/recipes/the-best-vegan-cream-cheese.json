    "1 1/2 cups raw cashews, soaked for 20 minutes in very hot water",
    "1/3 cup water (plus more as needed)",
    "2 1/2 Tbsp unsweetened plain coconut yogurt (for store-bought, we prefer Culina or CocoJune)",

    "1 Tbsp distilled white vinegar",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp lemon juice",
    "1 1/4 tsp white miso paste",
    "1/2 tsp sea salt",
    "1/4 cup refined (odorless) coconut oil, melted (NOT virgin coconut oil or your cream cheese will taste like coconut)"
