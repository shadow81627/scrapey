Once the sauce is boiling, reduce the heat to simmer and cover. Cook for approximately 20 to 30 minutes, or until the rice is chewy and tender, but still has a bite. You don’t want it to be mushy. Stir often to avoid sticking. If the liquid begins to evaporate too quickly, add more broth and reduce the temperature. This should be thick like a stew, not soupy."
