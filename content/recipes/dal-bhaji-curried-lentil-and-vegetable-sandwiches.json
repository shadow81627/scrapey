  "description": "Feel free to substitute other vegetables for the ones listed here: Cauliflower, cabbage, potatoes, and even beets all work well. To make it faster, try using riced cauliflower for part of the vegetables. If you’re not a fan of spicy food, be careful with the masala and the chili pepper. Add a little and taste; you can always add more if necessary.",
