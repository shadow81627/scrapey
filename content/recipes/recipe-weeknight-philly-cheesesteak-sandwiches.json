  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 large (1 to 1-1/2 pound) thick-cut rib-eye steak",
    "Neutral cooking oil, such as canola",
    "1 medium yellow onion, roughly chopped",
    "Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper (some people use Lawry’s salt, or add garlic powder)",
    "4 to 6 slices provolone or American cheese (or warmed Cheez Whiz)",
    "2 large hoagie or sub rolls, split open",
    "French fries, for serving"

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Place the rib-eye in the freezer and chill until semi-firm (not frozen solid), about three to four hours. Cut the steak into 4 smaller pieces. Working with one piece at a time — while leaving the rest in the freezer — use a mandolin or a sharp chef’s knife to slice the steak into razor-thin slivers. (If using a mandolin, I recommend investing in a cut-resistant glove.) Transfer the sliced meat to a medium bowl and set aside. Alternately, you can ask your grocer's butcher to do this for you if they have a meat slicer. If they agree, it will make life easy-peasy for you! (Side note: I keep all of the fat. Every last bit of it. It’s why you bought a rib-eye in the first place.)"

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Heat a large cast iron griddle, skillet, or other large pan over medium heat. Add a liberal pour of neutral oil, about 2 to 3 tablespoons, and add the onions. Season with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until tender, 3 to 6 minutes depending on desired doneness. (Make sure you are patient with this step!) Once the onions are done, push them aside (or transfer to another bowl if there's not enough space)."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Increase heat to medium-high and add another drizzle of oil if the griddle seems dry. Season the shaved rib-eye pieces generously with salt and pepper and add to the sizzling skillet. Cook the meat until browned and caramelized, which should happen quickly if the pan is smoking-hot. If you are cooking on a griddle or flat top, push the cooked steak into two separate piles and shape into roughly the same size as the hoagie roll. Shingle two to three slices of cheese over each stack of meat, allowing the cheese to melt while the meat is resting. (Alternately, you can transfer the meat to a separate plate to rest.)"
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "While the meat is resting, place the hoagie rolls flat-side down on the griddle and cook until lightly toasted. Using a large, flat spatula, gently scoop the meat and cheese mixture and transfer it into the hoagie roll. Slice in half crosswise and serve immediately. Serve with your favorite frozen French fries (cooked according to package directions, of course) and plenty of napkins."
