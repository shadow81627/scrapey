    "1 1/2 cups cranberries (~6 ounces as original recipe is written)",
    "1/2 medium ripe pear (Bartlett or Anjou // peeled + chopped // ~ 1 cup as original recipe is written)",
    "2 tsp orange zest",
    "2 Tbsp water",

    "1 750 ml bottle slightly dry champagne (I love Argyle Brut, available at Trader Joe's)"

      "text": "Bake for 20-22 minutes or until the fruit is bubbly and most of the cranberries have burst. Transfer mixture to a food processor or small blender and blend/mix on high until a compote consistency is reached. If needed, add more water to thin (see photo)."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Top with more champagne until the flutes or glasses are 3/4 full. Enjoy immediately! You will likely have leftover compote, which will keep for 1-2 weeks in the refrigerator."
