  "description": "This veggie ground is made with just a few simple ingredients that make for a chewy, juicy, meaty, totally vegan bite. Flavourful, but only lightly seasoned so you can use it anywhere where you would have used ground beef. Lasagna, pasta, burritos, tacos, sloppy joes, nachos, soups, shepherds pie... the options are endless! Make ahead of time, and store in the fridge or freezer for later so you have it on hand.",

Add the chopped beet along with the tofu crumbles, and mix with the seasoning making sure all of the tofu is evenly coated. Spread the crumbles evenly over the pan. Bake for 35 - 45 minutes, stopping to stir the tofu every now and then. Keep a close eye on it towards the end so that it doesn't burn. You want the tofu to be nice and browned. The smaller crumbles will be darker than the larger crumbles, and that's ok because it will provide a variety of texture."
