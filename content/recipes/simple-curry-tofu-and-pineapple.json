      "text": "Heat the oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onions and garlic and flash fry for approximately 2 minutes. Add the tofu, pineapple, peas, and coconut milk and stir until the milk is uniform. You shouldnâ€™t see clumps of the thick milk sitting in the pan. Add the curry, cumin, turmeric, ginger, nutmeg, cardamom, and salt and stir until fully combined. The broth should be a beautiful golden color. Bring to a boil and reduce to a low simmer for approximately 20 minutes. Stir frequently. The liquid will reduce and the broth will thicken. Sprinkle the cilantro and stir well."
