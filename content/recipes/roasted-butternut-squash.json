  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 medium butternut squash, peeled and cubed, seeds removed (~7 cups cubed)",
    "1 Tbsp avocado oil (or other neutral oil with high smoke point)",
    "1 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "1 healthy pinch sea salt and black pepper",
    "1-2 tsp curry powder"

      "text": "The best way to cut butternut squash is to start with a large, very sharp knife and a sturdy cutting board. To begin, cut off the top stem and bottom end of your squash and discard."
    },
    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Then cut the squash in half where the small, cylinder shape and round, bulb shape meet. Use a sharp knife (or a sturdy vegetable peeler) to carefully remove the skin (NOTE: You can leave it on as the skin is edible, but we prefer removing it for creamier texture). Remove any seeds with a spoon or ice cream scoop. Cut the squash into small (~1/2 - 3/4-inch) cubes. For a visual of how to chop squash, watch this short video."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (204 C) and line 1 large baking sheet with parchment paper or a non-stick sheet (use more baking sheets if making a larger batch â€” just know it will require more time to roast)."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "To a large mixing bowl or the prepared baking sheet(s), add cubed squash, avocado oil, maple syrup, salt, pepper, and curry powder or shawarma spice blend (optional). Toss until evenly coated with a spoon or spatula, then arrange in a single layer. Make sure there is a little room between the squash pieces to help them roast and get golden brown."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Best when fresh, though leftovers will keep in the refrigerator up to 2-3 days. Not freezer friendly once baked. Reheat on the stovetop over medium heat, or in a 350 degree F (176 C) oven or microwave until hot."
