  "headline": "How To Cook the Best Lamb Chops",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Make ahead: Lamb chops can be seasoned with salt, pepper, thyme, and lemon zest up to 1 hour in advance and refrigerated. Storage: Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 3 days. Cooking lamb blade or sirloin chops: To cook 4 (1-inch-thick) lamb blade or sirloin chops, season the chops as instructed above. Cook for 6 to 7 minutes per side or until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat registers 145°F. You may need to cook the chops in 2 batches to avoid crowding the pan. "
