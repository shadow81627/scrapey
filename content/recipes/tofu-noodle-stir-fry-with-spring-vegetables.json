    "1 (14-oz) block extra firm tofu, cut into 3/4-inch cubes",
    "4 Tbsp tamari",
    "1 Tbsp toasted sesame oil",
    "1/2 tsp red pepper flakes",
    "3/4 cup tahini stir-fry sauce",
    "4 ounces vermicelli (thin) rice noodles",
    "2 Tbsp toasted sesame oil",
    "4 stalks green onion, thinly sliced",
    "2 cloves garlic, minced",
    "8 cups chopped vegetables*",

      "text": "NOODLES: Place the noodles in a large bowl or pot and cover with just boiling water. Stir and let soak according to the package instructions (or for slightly less time). They should be tender but not mushy as they will continue cooking in the stir-fry. We found 2 minutes to be perfect. Drain, drizzle with a little bit of sesame oil to prevent sticking, and set aside."

      "text": "STIR-FRY: Heat a large wok or non-stick skillet over medium heat. Once hot, add the tofu along with the excess marinade. Sauté for about 8-12 minutes, flipping until each side is browned and the liquid is absorbed. Remove from the pan and set aside."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "With the pan/wok still over medium heat, add the sesame oil, green onions, and minced garlic. Sauté for ~1-2 minutes or until tender and fragrant. Add in the broccoli (or other sturdy vegetables such as onion, cauliflower, or green beans) and sauté until bright green and slightly tender but still crunchy (~3-5 minutes). Mix in the rest of the vegetables (carrot ribbons, baby bok choy, cabbage, and snap peas), and cook for 3-5 more minutes or until tender."
