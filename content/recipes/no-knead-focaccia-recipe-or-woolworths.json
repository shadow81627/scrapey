In a medium sized bowl, mix the flour, yeast, salt and 1 cup of the water together using the handle of wooden spoon (This makes it easier to combine the flour mix, preventing aeration and overworking the dough) Add 2 tbs of olive oil and continue to add water slowly until the dough becomes soft in texture."

The dough will be very sticky and have some elasticity so just keep gently moulding it to fit the tray. It won't matter if it's not evenly spread, that will add to the rustic appearance of the focaccia."
