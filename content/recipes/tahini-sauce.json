  "description": "This Tahini Sauce is tangy, nutty, creamy, and absolutely delicious. Drizzle it over falafel, veggies, chickpeas, tacos...or simply use it to dip some fresh pita or toasted sourdough bread! Itâ€™s so good you may even consider eating it with a spoon straight out of the bowl!",

Mixing well after adding each tablespoon. Add water until you reach the desired consistency. If making the tahini sauce ahead, note that it will thicken in the fridge and you may have to add a little more water to loosen it."
