      "text": "Meanwhile, whip cream and icing sugar together until thick. When cake is cool, gently unroll. Spread with cream and top with cherries. Re-roll and transfer to a serving plate. Dust with extra icing sugar. Tip 1: Once cooled, the roulade will have a natural curl to it that makes it easy to re-roll. Don’t worry if cracks appear – the icing sugar will help disguise them. Tip 2: Roll on dessert! Be famous for being cool in the kitchen and make the roulade the day before. After you’ve re-rolled it, wrap in plastic and chill. Dust with icing sugar just before serving."
