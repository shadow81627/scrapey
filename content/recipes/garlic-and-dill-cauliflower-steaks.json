Start by taking a big, sharp knife and cutting straight down, through the middle of the crown, so you've got two identical halves. Now make cuts into each of those halve, parallel to the original cuts and offset by about an inch. Repeat if you've got enough room for another slice, otherwise just stick with four slices. I ended up with four steaks and a few random florets, which I cooked along with the steaks for picking at."
