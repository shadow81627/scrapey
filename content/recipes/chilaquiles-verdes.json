Add the diced onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the onion starts to soften, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cumin over the onions. Cook for 30-60 seconds until cumin is fragrant and lightly toasted. Add the salsa verde and bring to a simmer; reduce heat to low and continue to cook for 8-10 minutes. (Don't allow the sauce to thicken too much, but if that happens, add a few tablespoons of water or broth to thin it out.)"
