No Bake. \nFULL RECIPE: https://www.veganricha.com/2019/09/curried-caramelized-brussels-sprouts.html\nMY BOOKS: https://veganricha.com/books\n\nVegan Gluten-free Soy-free Nut-free Recipe.\nWhats better than roasted Brussels Sprouts, These Pan caramelized and then smothered in tomato onion sauce Brussels Sprouts!!\n\nBrussels are caramelized on the pan with some whole cumin seeds and removed from the pan. Then the sauce is simmered with spices and the brussels tossed in the sauce to pick up some sauce flavor. The first step adds a nice caramelization and partly cooks the sprouts. So then they don’t need to be cooked too long with the sauce or get mushy or over cooked. Change up the flavors to preference and serve these as is or as a side!\n\nYou can serve these brussels with a side of your favorite curry and rice or with vegan meatloaf and mashed potatoes and gravy!\n\nAlso try my \nPan Roasted Brussels with Turmeric and Sesame Seeds: https://www.veganricha.com/2016/04/brussels-sprouts-subzi-indian-spices.html\nHerb Roasted Brussels sprouts and Cauliflower, no dry bits!:\nhttps://www.veganricha.com/2019/01/roasted-brussels-sprouts-and-cauliflower.html\n\n#veganrichareecipes #easyveganrecipes #caramelizedbrusselssprouts #indianrecipe\nMusic By Epidemic sound\n\nFollow: \nMy blog: https://veganricha.com\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/VeganRicha\nInstagram: https://instagram.com/veganricha\nTwitter: https://www.twitter.com/veganricha\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/veganricha/",
