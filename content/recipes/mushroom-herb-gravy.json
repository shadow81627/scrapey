    "8 oz mushrooms ($1.99)",
    "3 Tbsp all-purpose flour ($0.03)",
    "2 cups vegetable broth ($0.25)",

      "text": "Make sure that all of the moisture released by the mushrooms has evaporated and just the butter oil and mushrooms remain in the pan. Turn the heat down to medium-low, add the flour, and continue to sauté the flour with the mushrooms and butter. The flour will form a paste like mixture all over the mushrooms and eventually begin to coat the bottom of the skillet. Continue to sauté for 3-4 minutes, or just until the flour begins to turn golden brown on the bottom of the skillet. This will slightly toast the flour and give the gravy better flavor."

      "text": "Allow the mixture to come to a simmer. The gravy will begin to thicken as soon as it simmers. Allow the gravy to simmer for 7-10 minutes, whisking often, until it is the desired thickness. Remember that the gravy will continue to thicken as it cools. Taste the gravy and adjust salt and pepper to your liking."
