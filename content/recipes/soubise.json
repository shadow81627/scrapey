Transfer the mixture to a blender. Start the blender on low speed, then gradually increase the speed to high. Blend until a smooth sauce forms, about 1 minute."

Add 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/4 teaspoon ground white pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg, and stir to combine. Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. The soubise will have a texture that's thicker than most sauces but thinner than a purée. Keep warm over gentle heat until ready to serve."
