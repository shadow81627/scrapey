      "text": "Once bananas are frozen, melt your chocolate and coconut oil together. You can melt over a double boiler or in the microwave. I like to place a glass bowl in the microwave and microwave for 30 seconds at a time, stirring in between, until chocolate is smooth and melted."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Allow the chocolate to cool for just a minute or so. Place your frozen strawberry banana stack into the chocolate and use two forks to make sure it is completely coated with chocolate. Place chocolate covered stack on parchment paper and, if desired, top with a sprinkle of sea salt, crushed freeze dried strawberries or crushed dried banana chips. It’s best if you can move quickly during this step so the bananans and strawberries don’t thaw too much."

      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Once all of your stack are coated with chocolate, place back into the freezer until everything is completely frozen again, 30 minutes – 1 hour."
