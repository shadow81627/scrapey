It can go longer than four hours, if needed, and will only get more tender the longer it cooks). Keep the heat set on high as you shred the meat to continue to cook down and thicken the sauce. Taste the meat and sauce and add salt if needed. Serve hot over a bed of rice, in tacos, or stuffed into a burrito."
