Place 1 1/2 tablespoons of the filling 3 inches from the bottom corner and form into a 5-inch long log. Fold the bottom corner up and over the filling, pulling the wrapper taut over the filling. Fold the left and right sides over the filling so the points meet at the center and crease the sides so it now looks like an envelope. Roll from the bottom up into a tight log, stopping when you get close to the top and you have a small triangle left. Dip a finger into the egg white and use it to dampen the triangle, then finish rolling all the way up (the egg white will help “glue” the wrapper together)."
