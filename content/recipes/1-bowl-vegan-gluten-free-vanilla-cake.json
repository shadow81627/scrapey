  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 2/3 cup dairy-free milk (we used boxed coconut milk // almond or rice would also work)",
    "1 1/2 tsp apple cider vinegar (or lemon juice)",
    "1/3 cup unsweetened applesauce",
    "1 tsp pure vanilla extract",
    "3 1/4 cups almond flour (not meal // we prefer Wellbee's brand)",
    "1 scant cup potato starch (not flour)",
    "1/3 cup cornstarch (or you can try subbing arrowroot starch for grain-free)",
    "1 1/3 cup organic cane sugar*",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking powder",
    "1 1/2 tsp baking soda",
    "1/2 tsp salt (optional)",
    "2 sticks vegan butter, softened (we prefer Earth Balance soy-free buttery sticks)",
    "1/2 tsp pure vanilla extract",
    "3 1/2-4 cups organic powdered sugar (sifted)"

      "text": "Add dry ingredients to a large mixing bowl and whisk to combine. Then add wet ingredients to the dry ingredients and mix until well incorporated and no large lumps remain. The batter should be thick but pourable (see video). Add more almond flour if too wet or dairy-free milk if too thick."
