  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Storage: Store in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 4 days. The bread can also be sliced, then wrapped tightly in aluminum foil and frozen for up to 3 months.Muffin variation: Coat the wells of a 12-well muffin pan with cooking spray or line with paper liners. Divide the batter among the prepared muffin wells, about 1/3 cup batter per well. Bake, rotating the pan halfway through baking, until the muffins are golden, the tops bounce back when pressed, and a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes total. Let the muffins cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely."
