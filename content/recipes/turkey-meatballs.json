Rinse and shake dry about 1/4 bunch of parsley. Remove the leaves from the stem and roughly chop. Add the chopped parsley to the sausage along with the bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, egg white, sriracha sauce, worchestershire sauce, red pepper flakes and cracked black pepper (about 20 cranks of the pepper mill). When the onions and garlic are soft, add them as well. Use your hands to mix the ingredients together until it is an even, homogeneous mixture."

Let them brown on one side then carefully roll to another side and let brown. Continue to cook and roll the meatballs around until they are deep brown and crispy on most sides (they wonâ€™t be perfect spheres).
