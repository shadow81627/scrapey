    "3/4 cup plain unsweetened dairy-free milk (almond, cashew, or boxed coconut)",

    "1-1 1/2 Tbsp maple syrup",
    "1 dash sea salt",
    "1 Tbsp chia seeds",
    "1/2 cup rolled oats (gluten-free certified as needed)",

    "2 Tbsp coconut yogurt (we used plain Culina // any thick yogurt will do)",

Add more liquid as needed if oats get too thick/dry."
