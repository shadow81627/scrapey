Fry the onion, garlic and ginger for about 2 minutes, until fragrant and the onions have softened. Add the bay leaf and spices and fry for another minute until aromatic. Next, add the tomato paste, chopped tomatoes and cilantro, then cover and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and let it simmer, covered, for 5 minutes. Add the beans when they’re ready, along with the yogurt, syrup and lemon juice. Bring back to a boil, then remove from the heat."
