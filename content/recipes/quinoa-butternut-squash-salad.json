    "1 medium butternut squash",
    "2 tablespoons olive oil (, optional)",
    "1/2 teaspoon each of salt and pepper",
    "1 cup (170 grams) quinoa (, will equal about 3 cups of cooked quinoa)",
    "2 cups (480 mls) water",
    "4 cups (85 grams/ 3 oz) arugula (, some more or a bit less is fine though!)",
    "3/4 cup (115 grams) hazelnuts (, see recipe notes for nut-free option)",
    "3 tablespoons tahini (, or almond, hazelnut or cashew butter)",
    "2 tablespoons unsweetened applesauce (, or 1/4 of a medium apple)",
    "1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil",
    "2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar (, or white wine vinegar)",
    "1/2 teaspoon minced/crushed garlic",
    "1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon",
    "1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt (, plus more to taste)",
    "1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper",
    "1 to 2 tablespoons maple syrup",

      "text": "Cook the quinoa while the squash is roasting. Rinse it thoroughly in a sieve, then place in a saucepan with the water. Stir, cover with a lid and bring to a boil. Turn to medium and allow to simmer for 15 minutes then turn off the heat and leave it to sit without removing the lid for at least 10 minutes. Longer is fine. Then fluff with a fork before using. Or cook it in an Instant Pot. Rinse in a sieve, add to the Instant Pot with just 1 cup of water. Place the lid on, seal the vent and cook on manual for 2 minutes. Allow the pressure to release naturally then fluff with a fork."

      "text": "Make the dressing. Simply add all of the dressing ingredients to a jar and whisk them together or shake it up. Start with just a little of the water and no maple syrup, then check the texture and sweetness. Add maple syrup to get the right sweetness for you, and enough water to get the texture you prefer. I like it with a bit of a tang and quite creamy. If you only have fresh apple you will need to blend everything in a blender."

      "text": "Warm a small shallow pan over a medium heat and when hot add the hazelnuts. Roll them around in the pan for several minutes to toast them. They will start smelling toasty and nutty when done. Don't leave them alone as they will burn easily. Remove the pan from the heat and allow to cool."
