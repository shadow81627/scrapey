  "description": "9 ingredients and 15 minutes or less to make. This creamy dressing tastes just like the classic but it&#039;s dairy-free, healthy, oil-free, whole food plant-based! Drizzle this over every salad, bowl, or you can even use it as a dip.",

To do this add the cashews to a small pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil and cook for about 10 minutes until the cashews are very tender. Drain and rinse with cold water before using."

      "text": "Add the cashews to your blender along with 1 cup of water, apple cider vinegar, onion powder, garlic powder, and salt blend until completely smooth, stopping to scrape the sides as needed. Add the parsley, chives, and dill and pulse a few times to incorporate. Store in an air-tight container in the fridge for up to a week. The dressing gets thicker as it cools, and can even be used as a dip."
