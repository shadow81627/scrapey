  "description": "Dial the heat down in the tomato salsa by removing the ribs and seeds from the jalapeno. Any cheddar is good here, but we have a serious crush on the way sharp cheddar sets off all the other flavors. Looking for something milder? Mozzarella is your best bet. Sourdough toast or cheesy grits both make wonderful sides to this simple, sizzling dish.",
