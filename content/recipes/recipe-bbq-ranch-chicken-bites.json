    "text": "Grilling instructions: Heat an outdoor grill to medium-high (about 400Â°F). Place the skewers on the grill (work in 2 batches if needed), cover the grill, and cook undisturbed until grill marks appear on the chicken, 3 to 4 minutes. Using tongs, flip the skewers, cover the grill, and grill until the chicken is cooked through, 3 to 4 minutes more.Storage: Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days."
