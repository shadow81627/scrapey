    "1 cup honey-roasted peanuts, divided",
    "1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, divided",
    "1 2/3 cups chunky peanut butter (about 15 ounces), preferably Skippy Super Chunk",

Process until finely ground. Add 1/2 cup of the honey-roasted peanuts and pulse until the peanuts are coarsely chopped, about 4 (2-second) pulses. Add the melted butter and 1/4 teaspoon of the kosher salt. Pulse until combined and the peanuts are in smaller pieces but not finely ground."
