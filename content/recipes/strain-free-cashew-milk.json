  "description": "This is my most favourite milk recipe! No straining means no mess, means no waste! On top of that, all of the fiber and nutrients remain in the milk making this extra healthy. It even foams well for my morning latte!&nbsp;",

To boil the cashews: Cover the cashews with water in a small saucepan. Bring to a boil, and boil for about 10 minutes until the cashews are very tender."

You want to start with just 1 cup as I find that it blends smoother and doesn’t leave any cashew bits un-blended. Blend until completely smooth and creamy."
