      "text": "Working on the side of the cake, in vertical rows from bottom to top, pipe a single row of dots of each colour, each the size of a 10-cent piece. Use a small palette knife to smear each dot to the right to create a dragged effect, cleaning the palette knife after each colour. Start the next row using the last colour from the previous row (this creates a cascading, diagonal effect). Continue until the side of the cake is complete."
