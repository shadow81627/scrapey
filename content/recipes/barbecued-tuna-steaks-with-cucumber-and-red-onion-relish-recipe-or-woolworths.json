      "HowToTip": {},
      "text": "Rub each tuna steak on both sides with a little oil and smoked paprika, and season them well. Cook the tuna on the hot barbecue for 2-3 minutes on each side for medium, or 3-4 minutes for well done (and less for rare tuna, but only serve it this way if it is very fresh). It is easy to see if the tuna has cooked on one side, as the fish will turn opaque from the bottom upwards when looked at from the side. Remember that the fish will continue to cook when removed from the barbecue."
