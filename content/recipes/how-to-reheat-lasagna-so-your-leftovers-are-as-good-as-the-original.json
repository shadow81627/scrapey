And no matter how you reheat your lasagna, you can make sure it&#x27;s heated properly by taking its temperature with an instant read thermometer — the internal temperature should be 165°F.",

Remove any plastic wrap, then wrap the lasagna in aluminum foil and bake according to the original recipe (for lasagnas that were not previously baked) or at 375°F until heated through, which will likely take about an hour."
