Now let the water cook off and the sausage turn deep brown and firm. Heat the bacon fat in the skillet, and add the onion. Sauté until translucent, about 10 minutes. Add the thyme, bell pepper, chilis, and ground chili. Cook until the vegetables are well cooked but not deeply colored, about 10 minutes.
