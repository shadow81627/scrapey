Cupcake liners are preferable over greasing the pan because they prevent the sides from browning too much and yield a prettier result. But in a pinch, lightly grease instead."

The texture should be thick and look similar to cornbread batter (see photo). If too thick, thin with a little more dairy-free milk. If too thin, add a little more almond flour."

Itâ€™s better to slightly over-bake than under-bake these cupcakes to avoid gumminess."

These subtly sweet cupcakes pair nicely with a sweeter frosting such as our classic buttercream frosting, vegan chocolate ganache frosting, date-sweetened chocolate frosting or vegan strawberry frosting. For a lighter option, try lightly-sweetened coconut whipped cream and fresh berries."
