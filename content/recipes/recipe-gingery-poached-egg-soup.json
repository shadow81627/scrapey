    "description": "Poached eggs show up on eggs benedict, fris√©e salads, and noodle bowls, but one of my favorite ways to eat them are in a bowl of steaming hot broth. There's something soothing and comforting about breaking open a yolk and watching it meld into the savory soup underneath, and I love how the whites soak in some of the soup too. When I need a super-quick lunch that has some protein and a good dose of greens, this is my go-to. In under 15 minutes, you can make this ginger- and garlic-infused soup that's full of greens and eggs that are poached right into the soup. It's warming and satisfying yet won't weigh you down. Plus, most of the ingredients are pantry or refrigerator staples.",
