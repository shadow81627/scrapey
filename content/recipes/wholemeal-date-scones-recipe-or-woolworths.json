      "text": "Gently pat out dough on a lightly floured benchtop to a 2.5cm-thick disc. Cut out scones using a 6cm round cutter dipped in flour (see tip). Press leftover dough scraps together and cut out more scones. Place close together on prepared tray so they are just touching. Lightly brush the tops with extra milk. Bake in the centre of the oven for 12 minutes or until pale golden (scones should sound hollow when tapped). Wrap in a clean tea towel to keep warm until ready to serve."
