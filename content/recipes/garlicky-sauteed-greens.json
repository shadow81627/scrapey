    "1 Tbsp olive oil (or avocado oil)",
    "3-4 large cloves garlic (3-4 cloves yield ~1 1/2 Tbsp or 14 g)",
    "1/4 tsp red pepper flakes (optional)",
    "1 bunch hearty greens of choice, chopped",
    "1/4 tsp sea salt",
    "1 Tbsp lemon juice (~1/2 small lemon yields ~1 Tbsp or 15 ml juice)",
    "2-8 Tbsp water (or broth)"

      "text": "Once the greens have wilted slightly (1-2 minutes), add the salt and toss to evenly distribute. Add the lemon juice and 2 Tbsp (30 ml) water, reduce heat to medium-low, and cover with a lid. Let cook for 4-5 minutes, then remove the lid and toss."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "Depending on the type of greens you’re using, they may have released a bit of moisture or they may be dry (we find collard greens are the driest). The greens should be in a very shallow amount of liquid, not submerged or sizzling in a dry pan. Add the remaining water if needed and cover for another 10-15 minutes, stirring occasionally and adding water if needed. After 15 minutes, the greens should be fully tender, darker in color, and most of the liquid should have evaporated. Depending on your preferred texture, they may be done at this point or they may need 5-10 more minutes with a bit more water."
