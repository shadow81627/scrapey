      "text": "Because the chocolate is quite thin at this point, set in the refrigerator to chill and slightly thicken and make dipping the dates easier - about 15-20 minutes total, removing to stir/whisk occasionally. You'll know it's ready when it's more like pourable hot fudge than melted coconut oil."

      "text": "Next, carefully remove pits from dates and be careful to keep one side of the date intact, as opposed to splitting it into two separate pieces. You're trying to create a small crevice in the date (see photo) so it's easy to add/contain the tahini. Once pitted, fill with tahini - about 1/2 - 1 tsp depending on size of date."

Set back on the parchment baking sheet and immediately sprinkle with a little sea salt and either sesame seeds or coconut. Repeat until all dates are coated."
