  "description": "&quot;Vegetable couscous was a favorite of mine growing up and today I made it by myself for the first time. It was pretty quick, and just as tasty as I remembered. I also threw in some toasted almond slivers towards the end for a little crunch.&quot; E. VoisinIf couscous is not available, this easy dish can be served over whole grains, such as millet, quinoa, or brown rice.",
