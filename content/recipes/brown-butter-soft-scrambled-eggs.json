Continue to cook, swirling the pan occasionally, until the solids turn dark golden brown, and the butter smells nutty and toasted, 4 to 5 minutes. The butter may spit and splatter a bit, so feel free to reduce the heat to low if needed."

Immediately start swirling the pan while using the spatula to move the eggs, scraping around the edges and the bottom of the pan to release the cooked parts. Cook until the eggs are still a bit loose and wet, 1 to 3 minutes."

Taste and season with more kosher salt as needed. Divide the eggs between 2 plates and serve with hot sauce and toast if desired."
