    "1 3/4 cups buttermilk",
    "1 cup canned pumpkin purée (I prefer Libby)",
    "2 large egg yolks",
    "1 teaspoon vanilla extract",

Pour into the flour mixture and stir until almost combined, but with a few clumps of flour still remaining. Stir the reserved egg whites into the mixture until just combined.

      "text": "Heat about a tablespoon of oil in a large cast iron skillet or griddle on medium-high heat until shimmering. Add 1/4 cup portions of batter to the pan, pressing it out with the bottom of the measuring cup to help it spread out a bit. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the bottoms are golden brown and a bit crispy, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pancakes and continue cooking until set, 2 to 2 1/2 minutes more. (I like to do a small test pancake to adjust the temperature before cooking the remaining batter.) Re-heat the griddle before cooking additional batches of pancakes."
