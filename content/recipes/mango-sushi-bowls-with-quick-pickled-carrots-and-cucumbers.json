In a bowl, stir together the water, rice vinegar, agave nectar, salt and pepper. Pour this mixture over the vegetable ribbons, dividing it evenly between the two containers. Seal the containers and gently shake them a couple of times. Then transfer the containers to your refrigerator to chill for 1 hour. A longer refrigeration time is okay, too."
