In a heatproof bowl set over a pan of simmering water, melt the butter and chocolate together until smooth and glossy, stirring now and again.

      "text": "Put the egg whites in a mixing bowl with a pinch of salt and whisk with an electric hand whisk until soft peaks form. Gradually fold into the chocolate mixture, then pour into the cake tin and smooth the top. Bake for 1 hour, or until the top is firm but the middle still wobbles slightly when you shake the tin. Leave to cool completely in the tin. Remove and dust with cocoa powder or icing sugar before serving. Serve with single cream."
