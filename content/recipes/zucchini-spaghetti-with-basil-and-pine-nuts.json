Add zucchini, grated garlic, salt, and pepper and cook at medium heat for 3-5 minutes ( the time will depend on the texture you prefer. For firmer, \"crunchier\" zucchini noodles cook for less time). Take into consideration that the longer you cook the zucchini noodles, the more water they will release. Remove from heat and place in a shallow bowl."
