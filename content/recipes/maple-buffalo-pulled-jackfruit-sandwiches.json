Add the garlic and cook about 1 minute more, until very fragrant. Add the jackfruit, hot sauce, maple syrup, tomato paste, liquid smoke, and 1 cup of water. Stir well, bring the mixture to a simmer and allow to cook, uncovered, for about 20 minutes. Stir every few minutes and after about 10 minutes begin using a couple of forks to break up and pull apart the pieces of jackfruit. It should be stringy and tender by the time it's done cooking. Continue to simmer until the jackfruit is very tender, about 20 minutes total. You can add a bit of water during cooking if the sauce gets too thick."
