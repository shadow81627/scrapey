  "description": "This Szechuan-style dish gets its heat from the chili sauce. Look in your Asian market for chili sauce or garlic chili sauce that has red chilies as its primary ingredient. Try to find the kind with the seeds intact, not the smoother type. Then adjust the amount to your desired level of spiciness.",
