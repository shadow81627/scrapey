Fry until it’s golden brown, approximately 3 to 5 minutes, and then use the tongs to flip. Fry another 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Place on the paper towels to drain the excess oil.To oven fry, heat the oven to 425 ̊F (218 ̊C) and bake for approximately 10 minutes per side, or until golden brown.
