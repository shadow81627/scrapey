  "recipeCategory": "main",
  "recipeIngredient": [
    "1 1/2 cups quinoa (soaked overnight in water)",
    "1/2 cup water",
    "1 teaspoon dried Italian herb blend",
    "1/2 to 1 teaspoon sea salt",
    "1/4 teaspoon granulated garlic",
    "freshly ground black pepper",
    "2-4 Tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (for pan(s)",
    "1-2 teaspoons olive oil",
    "1/2 large onion (thinly sliced)",
    "2-3 garlic cloves (roughly chopped)",
    "1/4 cup thinly sliced red bell pepper",
    "1/4 cup julienned sun-dried tomatoes",
    "1 cup organic baby spinach",
    "1/4 to 1/2 cup artichoke hearts (roughly chopped)",

Puree until smooth, scraping down the sides of the blender as needed. The batter should be thick, but still pourable. (Kind of like pancake batter.) Set aside until oven is hot enough."

      "text": "Place the skillet or cake pans into the hot oven and let heat for about 5 minutes. Remove from oven and add the olive oil. Carefully tilt pan to cover with the oil. (Use 2 tablespoons of oil per pan.) Immediately pour the quinoa batter into the pan and place in the oven. Let bake for 15 minutes."
