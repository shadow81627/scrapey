  "headline": "Recipe: Falafel Scotch Eggs",
  "HowtoTip": {
    "text": "Store-bought sauce: Instead of making the yogurt dipping sauce, you can also serve the Scotch eggs with store-bought hummus or tzatziki dip.Make ahead: The eggs can be boiled and stored in the refrigerator up to 1 day ahead. Remember to soak the chickpeas overnight (18 to 24 hours) for best results. Form the Scotch eggs up to 3 hours ahead and refrigerate until ready to fry.Storage: Leftover Scotch eggs can be stored in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 5 days. Reheat in a 325°F oven for 15 to 20 minutes."
