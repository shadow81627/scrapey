    "2 shallots (thinly-sliced)",
    "2 tablespoons rice vinegar",
    "juice of 1 lime",
    "1 block firm tofu",
    "3 tablespoons soy sauce",
    "1/2 tablespoon sriracha or other chili sauce",
    "1/2 tablespoon toasted sesame oil",
    "3 green onions (white and light green parts, finely chopped)",
    "1 ripe mango (cubed (I used a very ripe Tommy Atkins mango, but other varieties should also work)",
    "pickled shallots (see recipe above)",
    "(optional) chopped toasted macadamia nuts, for garnish",
    "(optional) sesame seeds, for garnish"

      "text": "Drain excess liquid from the tofu, then place it in an airtight container in the freezer at least overnight. The day you want to make the tofu poke, take out the tofu in the morning and place it in the refrigerator to thaw. You can also thaw it more quickly by gently running warm water over it. If there end up being frozen pieces in the middle when you go to cube the tofu, you can rescue it by microwaving it at 20-second intervals until thawed, but keep in mind that this dish is best served cold."

    {
      "@type": "HowToStep",
      "text": "After the tofu has thawed, wrap it with a clean towel or paper towels and put a heavy pan or a book on top of it to press out any extra liquid that remains. Don't do this too aggressively, as thawed frozen tofu can be a bit delicate. Press the tofu for 10 minutes (you can prepare the pickled shallots in the meantime)."
