  "description": "In the hierarchy of all the ways to cook a sweet potato, perfectly roasted chunks of sweet potato will forever sit at the top of my list. I'm not talking about a quick flash in a screaming-hot oven when you're in a hurry to get dinner on the table. I'm talking about those perfectly roasted, substantially sized cubes with well-browned, caramelized edges that crackle when you bite through the crisp surface and into the creamy center. The kind so impossibly irresistible you can't help but risk burning your fingertips and tongue to pop a few into your mouth the second the baking sheet comes out of the oven. Whether you prefer plain roasted sweet potatoes with just a sprinkling of salt or like to give them an extra sweet or savory twist, they're easy to make once you know the few key steps to success. Here's how to do it.",
