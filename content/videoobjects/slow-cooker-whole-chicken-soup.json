  "description": "The smell of classic chicken soup, fragrant with herbs and vegetables, is one of the most comforting smells that a kitchen can produce. The key to a good soup that's intensely chicken-y is a long, slow simmer. Naturally the slow cooker is chicken soup's best friend, as it can cook all day without any supervision from you. Starting with a whole chicken guarantees a soup that has plenty of flavor and lots of meat to shred to keep things nice and hearty, plus you'll produce quarts of soup to pack for lunch, take to friends, or stash away in the freezer for an easy, healthy dinner.",
