  "description": "Have you discovered pot-in-pot Instant Pot cooking yet? The technique, which allows you to make two distinct dishes in your Instant Pot in just one round of cooking, is especially revolutionary for weeknight dinners. My favorite of these pot-in-pot recipes is meatloaf and mashed potatoes. The potatoes are boiled to tenderness in the bottom of the pot, while homey meatloaf is cooked in a cake pan set atop the Instant Pot's trivet. With pot-in-pot cooking, you can have homemade meatloaf and mashed potatoes in under an hour. Here's how to do it.",
