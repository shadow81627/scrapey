  "description": "Cooking en papillote (french for “enveloped in paper”) is a great way to steam food. It takes a (very) little bit of advanced prep, but you can assemble packets a day or two in advance and have dinner ready in minutes for yourself or for a party. It’s relatively hands off, and it’s easy clean-up. \n\nThe method works best with quick-cooking proteins and vegetables, that can cook for about the same amount of time — think salmon or whitefish, broccoli, zucchini, peas, etc. The wonderful thing about the packets is that you can easily add herbs, butter, and seasoning — things that would be harder to add in traditional steaming — to get a denser melding of flavor, while maintaining the gentle cooking.\n\nMore on steaming here: https://www.thekitchn.com/how-to-steam-22954216",
