  "description": "1. To prep the tofu: Prepare the tofu by draining it, and then pressing it for 20 minutes to 1 hour. Follow these instructions for a DIY tofu pressing method: https://itdoesnttastelikechicken.com/ultimate-guide-pressing-tofu/ \nPressing the tofu squeezes excess water out so that the tofu can suck up more of the marinade and also will make the texture a bit chewier.\n2. In the meantime make the sauce by adding the lime juice, soy sauce, agave, lime zest, and black pepper to a measuring cup or bowl and mixing well. Set aside\n3. Once the tofu is pressed, use your fingers to pull the tofu apart into large chunks.\n4. Heat the oil in a large skillet or frying pan and fry the tofu for 5 - 8 minutes, stirring often, until the tofu is golden. Push the tofu to the side and add the garlic and saut√© for 1 minute until fragrant and just beginning to brown. Pour the sauce over the tofu and cook for another 2 - 3 minutes. Garnish with cilantro and crushed red pepper flakes. Remove from heat and serve the tofu over rice or noodles.",
