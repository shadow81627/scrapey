  "description": "Love it or hate it, pumpkin season is upon us. This means it's time for warm cider, sweaters, and my favorite fall pastime: baking. I love making autumn apple cakes, flaky homemade pies, and anything involving pumpkin. It's one of the ingredients I look forward to baking with the most, and the moment September rolls around I make sure to pick up a can or two.\n\nThe pumpkin-spiced treat I get most excited to make are these cookies. They're everything you love about a classic chewy-yet-crisp chocolate chip cookie amped up with a generous amount of pumpkin and warm spices. They're soft, flavorful, and rolled in sugar to give them a decadent crunch and stunning shimmer. And to make things even better, they don't require a mixer and are made entirely without eggs. Here's how to make them.\n\nSee full recipe post [HERE](https://www.thekitchn.com/pumpkin-chocolate-chip-cookies-recipe-23076069)",
