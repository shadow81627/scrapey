  "description": "I didn't think chicken tikka masala could really get much better, but then I remembered my best gadget friend: the slow cooker. This is a curry dish that benefits from a nice, long simmer anyway, so why not let that happen while I'm off doing other things? That's what I call smart cooking. Spooned over some steamed rice, this easy slow cooker tikka masala is about to make your busy days very happy indeed.",
