  "description": "While there's definitely an argument to be made for taking your knives to a pro to get sharpened, there's also a case to be made for doing it yourself. \"I highly recommend knife sharpening,\" says Eivin Kilcher, homesteader, cookbook author, and one of our \"Cutting Board\" knife experts. \"It really is a great skill to bring into your life and an important thing to be able to do at home.\" That said, the first time you do it — and even the first dozen times you do it — can be intimidating. But practice makes perfect. Even Kilcher, who has been using knives since he was 10, notes, \"Every time I sharpen a knife, I'm getting better.
