  "description": "These creamy Popsicles are just the thing for rushed mornings. They're sweet with the deep, caramelized flavor of roasted bananas, get a big protein boost from both Greek yogurt and peanut butter, and are filled with a few slices of fresh banana for texture. Make a batch, tuck them into your freezer, and reach for one whenever you need a quick breakfast that will cool you down in the process, which is always helpful during these hot and sticky days.",
