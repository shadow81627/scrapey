  "description": "In this video I show you how to make my favourite vegan holiday roast. This stuffed roasted butternut squash is the perfect main centerpiece for your vegan Thanksgiving, Christmas, or any holiday celebration. Not only is it beautiful to look at, but the roasted squash is stuffed with a wild rice, walnut, dried cranberry, and sage stuffing that is so incredibly delicious! This entire stuffed butternut squash recipe can be made ahead of time, and simply heated through when ready to serve, making it the perfect make ahead stress-free holiday season :)",
