  "description": "In this video, I try to make vegan black ice cream. Black ice cream made with charcoal has been trending this summer, but vegan versions are hard to come by, so I make my own recipe and show you how to make black ice cream at home! My DIY black ice cream recipe wouldn't be complete without a black ice cream cone so I even experiment and make that too! I hope you enjoy this video!",
