  "description": "In this video, I show you how to make Irish stew. This vegetable stew recipe is hearty, satisfying, rich, and perfect for St. Patrick's Day recipes. Traditional Irish stew is made with beef and Guinness beer. Obviously beef isn't vegan, so I skip that and replace it with hearty vegetables. And beer isn't (believe it or not) isn't always vegan either as they sometimes use isinglass (fish blatters...ew) to filter the beer. Guinness is currently in the process of changing their recipe to be vegan. I know it is vegan in some areas but not yet everywhere. In my vegan stew recipe, I used a local beer which is vegan-friendly. \nUse the app: http://vegaholic.com/\nor the site: http://www.barnivore.com/\nto find a vegan beer perfect for your easy stew recipe.",
