  "description": "Marie Kondo has totally changed the way I view my home and all the \"stuff\" I have accumulated over the years. You see, I'm generally a pretty sentimental person, so normally things like pants that don't fit me would be \"hard\" to donate or throw away because memories. And even though I'm not a perfect Kondo follower by any means, she's helped me understand my relationship with objects and organizing in ways that have had a huge impact on my life. I know, super corny, but it's true. All this is to say that I'll basically read or watch Marie Kondo do anything because she is so inspiring and thoughtful in everything she does. This is exactly why we asked her to visit our office and show us a thing or two on small ways to organize in the kitchen. Watch these videos and feel at peace.",
