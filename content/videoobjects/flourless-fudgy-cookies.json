  "description": "If your ideal cookie has thin, crispy edges that enclose a thick, fudgy middle with just a touch of chewiness in between, then you should definitely be making these flourless chocolate cookies. At first glance, they might look like any other chocolate cookie, but these cookies have a deep chocolate flavor and are studded with dark chocolate chips. The fact they there are flourless and require just one bowl for mixing is just gilding the lily.",
