  "description": "While marinades are brilliant at turning cuts of meat that can often dry out when cooked into flavorful, moist meals, it's easy to forget to plan ahead and get that meat into a marinade well before you're ready to cook it. Enter: the freezer marinade, when you bring that meat home from the grocery store toss it in a marinade first and freeze it right in it. It will absorb the marinade whenever you decide to thaw it, and then all you have to do is bake, saut√©, or grill it. This is a weeknight dinner game-changer.",
