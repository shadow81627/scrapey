  "description": "Oven roasting brings out the best in all vegetables, including Brussels sprouts. The oven's heat caramelizes the Brussels sprout's leaves, turning them lacy and crisp while tenderizing their tough core. And that's just with a basic sprinkling of salt and pepper! Once roasted, Brussels sprouts can be served as a side straight from the oven, or you can toss them with a few other kitchen staples to turn them into a showy number studded with bacon and glazed with honey. Oven-roasted Brussels sprouts require three things: a hot oven, halved and trimmed Brussels sprouts, and enough time for the sprouts to transform into tender, tasty morsels. You'll need a good baking sheet and some oil, salt, and pepper, but anything else is superfluous. Here's how to get the very best Brussels sprouts by oven roasting.",
