  "description": "Few things are better than tucking into a slice of buttery, toothsome cornbread while it is still warm. I grew up on the blue boxed kind that my mom always baked in a cast iron skillet and dressed up with a brush of honey and butter. Then I spent about 10 years in the Southern US where cornbread is dogmatic and tender, but hardly ever sweetened. Since then I've been on a quest for a fluffy, slightly sweet cornbread inspired by both those cornbread experiences, a cornbread recipe that I could bake at home without a mix and have confidence it would turn out perfectly every time. This recipe is it â€” a golden sheet of tender cornbread with a little bit of sweetness and lots of rich buttery flavor. \n\nGet the full recipe: https://thekitchn.com/cornbread-22943699",
