  "description": "In this video, Sam shows you her recipe for vegan seitan steak! This is the best vegan steak around. Seith steak is made from vital wheat gluten, which is the protein in wheat, and is also what makes pizza dough stretchy and elastic. Making this vegan steak from scratch allows us to infuse the vegan steak with tons of flavour. Finish off the vegan seitan steak recipe on the BBQ, in a grill pan, or by frying it. After that, you can enjoy it however you like! Vegan steak and chips, a vegan steak strips on a sandwich or a salad.\n",
