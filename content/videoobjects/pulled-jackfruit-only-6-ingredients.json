  "description": "3 cheers for pulled jackfruit! Hip hip hooray! Jackfruit is the vegan version of pulled pork! This pulled jackfruit is so easy to whip up with only 6 ingredients. I use it to make a pulled jackfruit sandwich, but you could also pile it into a burrito, on tacos, or anywhere you like! ",
