  "description": "In this video I show you how to make the best shepherd's pie ever!!! My vegan lentil shepherd's pie. This is a great recipe because it can be made ahead of time making it an easy weeknight dinner, but it looks pretty enough for the main dish at a holiday party. My lentil shepherd's pie is topped with garlic mashed potatoes taking it to the next level of awesomeness! This makes for seriously the best lentil shepherd's pie recipe ever!!!! :) Disclaimer: This video description contains affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases",
