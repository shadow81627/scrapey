  "description": "This One Good Thing will transform your morning coffee routine.  \n\nDo you make only a cup or two of coffee every morning? Do you do it the old fashioned way, and pour hot water into a cone filter? I've done it that way for years and my mother did too, but I HATED standing over the filter and endlessly pouring. This past winter I discovered this amazing new design from OXO, their Pour Over Coffee Dripper with Auto-Drip Water Tank, which is really just a nice filter holder with a smart water reservoir and cap. Ta-da! No more standing and pouring! It is a brand new one good thing to transform your mornings. Enjoy and remember, one good thing is better than many so-so things.\n\nFind the OXO Pour Over Coffee-Maker: https://amzn.to/2TgiEEW",
