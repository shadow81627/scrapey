  "description": "In this video I show you how to make my vegan cream of mushroom soup recipe! This mushroom soup takes just 20 minutes to make and is completely dairy free. Instead of dairy products I use coconut milk for a rich creamy taste. I am obsessed with the combination of coconut and mushrooms together!! I hope you love my vegan mushroom soup recipe as much as I do :) Disclaimer: This video description contains affiliate links. As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases",
