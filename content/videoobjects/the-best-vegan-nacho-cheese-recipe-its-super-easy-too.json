  "description": "In this video, I show you how to make the best vegan nacho cheese recipe! I show you how to make easy vegan nacho cheese that not only tastes great, but is melty, stretchy, and gooey! This vegan cheese recipe only takes 15 minutes to make from start to finish. You can use it anywhere you like, on a baked potato, over broccoli, to make a grilled cheese, or (my fave) to make an epic plate of vegan nachos!
