  "description": "This is my most favourite vegan chili recipe ever! Unlike a lot of vegetarian chili recipes, this isn't just layers of beans. In my vegan chili recipe I dry season and then dry out tofu, and stir it into the chili. This make the tofu this amazing chewy, super satisfying chili that is above and beyond any meatless chili I have ever tried. I hope you love this recipe as much as I do!",
