  "description": "For those of us who use baking as a way to destress and temporarily disconnect from the world, ending up with more desserts than you (or anyone) can actually eat is a real issue. Sure, you can give them away to friends, family, and loved ones (and yes, you can do this safely), but you could also funnel your energy into another kind of baked goods: the breakfast kind. Muffins, scones, and biscuits are all great projects that will satisfy your baking itch and they can also feed you all week long. It's meal prepping and stress- baking in one.\n\nHere are 10 baked goods that make perfect breakfasts, from savory cheddar biscuits to perfect lemon poppyseed muffins.",
