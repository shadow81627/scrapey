  "description": "McKenzie's Tapioca Flour is a delicious and versatile alternative to wheat flour^. With a slightly sweet yet mild flavour, this flour has a starchy texture making it great to use as a thickener. ^Tapioca flour is not a direct substitute for wheat flour, so only use it in tried and tested recipes.",
