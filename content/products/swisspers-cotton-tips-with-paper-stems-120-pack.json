  "description": "Swisspers market leading premium cotton tips now with a paper stem. <br> <p>Swisspers Cotton Tips are made from 100% cotton and sustainably sourced paper stems. In addition to cleaning the outer ear, they are ideal for precision application and touch-ups of make-up.</p><p>The stiff paper stem gives you greater control compared to a standard plastic stem - plus switching to paper stems reduces single-use plastics in our environment. The re-sealable plastic bag uses 90% less plastic than a conventional tub and can be recycled at a RedCycle soft plastics collection points.</p>",
