  "description": "This classic Christmas centrepiece won the Silver medal in the 2022 Royal Tasmanian Fine Food Awards. A symphony of flavours come together in this Christmas centrepiece with hints of smokiness, sweet honey and fig. We've smoked this tender juicy ham with mountain ash wood and sourced the honey in our sticky glaze from the Northern Rivers region of NSW to create a sensational, easy-to-carve main that stands out on the table.\n Made in Australia by SunPork Fresh Foods who are owned and operated by three Australian families. The SunPork Fresh Foods team have a farming history which dates back over three generations and combines more than 100 years of experience in pig farming. They produce exceptional pork products by controlling the entire supply chain from farm to plate to protect the quality of their pork.\nClick here to discover more products in our Gold range, exclusively for Woolworths.\nOven Baking Instructions \n\n1) Preheat oven to 220 째C (Fan Forced 200 째C).
