  "description": "Famous for their smooth, buttery flesh Hass avocados are a delightful addition to any meal.\nThey have a pebbly skin that changes colour as they ripen from green to purple-black.\nStore firm fruit on the bench for a day or two and move to the fridge to hold in a ripe and ready to eat state once they begin to soften.",
