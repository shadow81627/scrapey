  "description": "Ribs are succulent, meaty cuts on the bone. Rich and packed full of flavour, these ribs are best suited to marinades and slow cooking, enabling the meat to fall cleanly off the bone. Drovers Choice offers a selection of beef products that are great value, 100% Aussie and with no added hormones.",
