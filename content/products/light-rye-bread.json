  "description": "This dark (not-so) mysterious loaf has us all running for its deep and malty flavours. Our softer twist on the classic is baked with our home-grown rye flour and topped with a sprinkle of semolina to give a gentle crunch. It's perfect for a Reuben sandwich... or really any way you like it.",
