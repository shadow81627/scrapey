Between World War 1 and World War 2, Edwin (‘Ted’) Street thanks to his wife and brother laid the foundations (in Corrimal, NSW) for what would ultimately become Australia’s biggest and best-known ice cream manufacturer. Streets ice cream was originally made in the back shed by Ted Street. He would then sell these to neighbours along with sweets, cakes and lemonade. Popularity grew, and he soon used a cart, then a one horse power motorbike to sell Streets ice cream. It continued to grow and today Streets ice cream is sold throughout Australia and New Zealand with well-known brands such as Magnum, Viennetta, Paddle Pop, Cornetto, Gaytime, Calippo and Blue Ribbon.
