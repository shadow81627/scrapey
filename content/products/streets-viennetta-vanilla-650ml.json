  "description": "VIENNETTA ICE CONFECTION VANILLA 650 MLStreets Vanilla Viennetta is an iconic Aussie dessert. Wave after wave of creamy vanilla ripples flowing over layers of chocolatey deliciousness, the unmistakable crack of Streets Viennetta is more than enough to make mouths water! There's no better frozen dessert to share with the family than Viennetta, it's ready to serve, hassle-free and the perfect crowd pleaser to spread happy smiles. Between World War 1 and World War 2, Edwin (‘Ted’) Street with the help of his wife and brother laid the foundations (in Corrimal, NSW) for what would ultimately become Australia’s biggest and best-known ice cream manufacturer. Streets ice cream was originally made in the back shed by Ted Street. He would then sell these to neighbours along with sweets, cakes and lemonade. Popularity grew, and he soon used a cart, then a one horsepower motorbike, to sell Streets ice cream. It continued to grow and today Streets ice cream is sold throughout Australia and New Zealand with well-known brands such as Magnum, Viennetta, Paddle Pop, Cornetto, Gaytime, Calippo and Blue Ribbon.Soft waves of vanilla flavoured ice creamCrisp layers of delicious chocolate curlsA classic Aussie dessertGet your hands on this delicious frozen dessert to impress any crowd or family gatheringHassle-free and ready to serve dessertThe unmistakable crack of Streets Viennetta is more than enough to make mouths water!",
