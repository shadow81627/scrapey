  "description": "Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Whitening Toothpaste provides clinically proven instant and lasting relief for sensitive teeth.<BR><BR>Where does sensitive tooth pain come from?<br />- Receding gums and damage to your enamel can expose thousands of microscopic channels which lead to your tooth's nerve centre.<br />- When your teeth make contact with something hot, cold or sweet, sensations are carried down these channels directly to the nerves, causing teeth pain.<br /><br />How does Colgate Sensitive Pro-Relief Whitening toothpaste work?<br />- It works by plugging the channels that lead to sensitive tooth nerves, to block the pain.<br />- With regular use, it builds a long-lasting protective barrier that acts like a seal against sensitivity.<br />- It's low abrasive formula gently and effectively removes stains, helping to restore the natural whiteness of your teeth.<br /><br />For instant relief, apply directly to each sensitive tooth with finger tip and gently massage for 1 minute, up to twice daily.<br /><br />For lasting relief, apply to a gentle toothbrush making sure to brush all sensitive areas of teeth. Brush twice daily.<br /><br />Always read the label. Follow the directions for use.
