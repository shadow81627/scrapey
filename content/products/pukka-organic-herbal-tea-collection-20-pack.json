  "description": "Herbal Collection, your own mini herbal adventure in a magical box of Pukka herbal teas. Five delicious, organic award-winning teas with each using three varieties of incredible organic herbs to create exceptional flavours and sensory experiences.Infuse for up to 15 minutes. Boiling just the water you need helps make every cup of Pukka tea as sustainable as it can be. Every Pukka plastic-free tea bag comes in its own recyclable envelope to retain the essential oils in our organic herbs. Each bag has two chambers, allowing these incredible herbs to flow and release the full potency in your cup. To help the flavours to fully disperse, pour boiling water directly on the bag. Every herb loves the water, so leave them to steep for the perfect brew. And remember to boil just the amount of water you need to make your cuppa as environmentally-friendly as it can be. Deliciousness knows no deeper colour. At Pukka, our heartfelt desire is to create a healthier, happier world through the incredible power of organic herbs. We hope you feel inspired to discover more about yourself and the beautiful planet on which we all live. Doing good things helps make good things happen. We create things that help you, help nature and everything in-between. It's called conservation through commerce - striving to positively change the world for you, business and the planet. We are a B Corp organisation, Giving back 1% for the Planet, Fair for Life and FairWild certified. Your box of herbal delight.",
