Thanks to our 4 layer InstaDry® Technology, each pad absorbs up to 10x it's weight so you can be sure you're totally covered. Curved wings and our clever BodyFit® shape will keep your pad in place, so you can get back to kicking all of the #goals.Smaller pads for smaller bodies4 Layer InstaDry® technology for quick fluid absorptionExtra thin for comfort & securityAbosrbent core (Absorbs up to 10x it's weight)",
