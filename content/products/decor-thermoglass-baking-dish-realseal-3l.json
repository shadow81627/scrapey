The realseal lid, which has a steam/air release vent, allows use of the Thermoglass dishes in the microwave for convenient cooking and reheating. The soft silicone seal in the lid makes the dishes airtight and leakproof, so prepared meals or leftovers can be stored in the fridge and freezer.\nProduct Features;\n• Premium heat-resistant borosilicate glass.\n• Steam/air release vent.\n• Airtight and leak-proof.\n• Dishwasher safe.\n• Freezer safe.\n• BPA Free",
