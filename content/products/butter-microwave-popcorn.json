      "value": "DO NOT LEAVE MICROWAVE UNATTENDED WHEN COOKING, AS THE ABOVE TIME GUIDE ONLY. STAY AND LISTEN: Stop microwave when popping begins to slow down to about 2 to 3 pops per second. REMOVE: Bag is hot! Remove bag from the microwave. Carefully open the bag by pulling diagonally at the corners away from the face and body. Do not overcook. It is normal for some kernels to remain unpopped. If you see or smell burning, stop the microwave immediately. Overcooking will burn product, and may result in microwave damage."
