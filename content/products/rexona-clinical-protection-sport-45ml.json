This deodorant has clinical wetness protection with an odour fighting technology. Unique odour control technology that is activated by movement keeps you fresh when you need it the most. Our products are intelligently designed to work as hard as you do. We make it our business to know more about sweat, and what we learn informs every product innovation. Sweat, also known as perspiration, is a normal and healthy bodily function and it starts to occur just a few months after birth. We mainly sweat to cool our bodies down, a process called thermoregulation. Our brain sends a signal to over 3 million glands in our body to release sweat (a clear fluid made of water, salts and proteins). As this fluid evaporates from our skin, it lowers our body temperature. Rexona entered the world of professional sports, backing some of the world’s best sports men and women. To this day, Rexona continues to provide ultimate protection at even the busiest of times. Rexona was created in Australia in 1908 by Mrs Alice Sheffer, the wife of SF Sheffer, the founder of the Sheldon Drug Company. A talented physician, she wanted to give people a new kind of personal care product, with effective ingredients that also smelt good. When Rexona hit the shelves in 1908, it soon became the company’s biggest seller <br/> Alcohol* and aluminium chloride free (*ethyl alcohol) <br/> Up to 3x more wetness protection than a basic antiperspirant deodorant <br/> Rexona's most advanced formulation <br/> Unique odour control technology activated by movement <br/> All-day freshness and protection <br/> Water-resistant</p>",
