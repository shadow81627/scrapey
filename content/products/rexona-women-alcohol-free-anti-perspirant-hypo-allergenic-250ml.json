We make it our business to know more about sweat, and what we learn informs every product innovation.<br/><br/>Sweat, also known as perspiration, is a normal and healthy bodily function and it starts to occur just a few months after birth.<br/>We mainly sweat to cool our bodies down, a process called thermoregulation. Our brain sends a signal to over 3 million glands in our body to release sweat (a clear fluid made of water, salts and proteins). As this fluid evaporates from our skin, it lowers our body temperature. <br/><br/>Rexona entered the world of professional sports, backing some of the world’s best sports men and women. To this day, Rexona continues to provide ultimate protection at even the busiest of times.<br/>Rexona was created in Australia in 1908 by Mrs Alice Sheffer, the wife of SF Sheffer, the founder of the Sheldon Drug Company.
