  "description": "With its generously deep and vertical walls, this tin is ideal for baking bread, loaf cakes and tea breads, producing a deep loaf with the perfect bloom and no bleeding of the top of the cake over the sides.  The tin's non-stick coating means you can easily turn out your bakes looking lovely and in one piece. The heavy-duty carbon steel conducts heat evenly ensuring a good even bake, and it's designed to withstand temperatures of up to 240Â°C.",
