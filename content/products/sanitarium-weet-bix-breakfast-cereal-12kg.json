  "description": "Sanitarium Weet-Bix Breakfast Cereal Value Pack contains low sugar, like it's always been. Weet-Bix has always been this good... High fibre, high in vitamins B1, B2 & B3 for energy and high in iron to help fight tiredness and fatigue.Golden goodness from Aussie farms to Aussie kidsFor more than 90 years we’ve made Weet-Bix right here in Australia. And because it’s made from 97% wholegrains, only the best ingredients will do.That’s why we source crisp golden wheat from farms in sun-drenched southern Queensland and the rolling western plains of New South Wales. Our growers say the key to creating top quality wheat is about harvesting the grain when the moisture content is just right. We think generations of Australian farming experience, care for the land and a passion for quality plays a big part too.  But we both agree. It’s this wheat that helps make Weet-Bix one of Australia’s favourite ways to start the day. Made simply and low in sugar, the natural goodness of Australian wholegrains shines through.For Aussie kids, only the best will do. Enjoy!97% wholegrainLow SugarHigh FibreAussie Owned & MadeHigh in Vitamins B1, B2 & B3High in Iron",
